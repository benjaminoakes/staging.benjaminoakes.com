## A slight change of plans

Your schedule just has Ben's name, but why not pair present?

Enter Daria and Trish

## Ben

* Senior Software Engineer
* January 2013: Started at Continuity when there was 1 full time engineer total (now there are 10)
* Paired in a few jobs, pushed for it at Continuity

## Daria

* Junior Software Engineer
* June 2013: started as an intern at Continuity when there were 3 engineers
* Has pair programmed since she started as a pro

## We all pair program remotely (and locally)

*(Trish)*

But our company's headquarters are in Connecticut.

We do web development with Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and client-side JavaScript.

## Define pairing

*(Ben)*

Two people at the same computer solving the same problem at the same time.

### Ingredients

* 2 keyboards
  * Read-write access for both participants at any time
* Some kind of voice communication: in person or VoIP software
* Screen sharing: a shared monitor, remote desktop software, or terminal sharing software
  * Very difficult to effectively pair with only Skype and Google Hangouts

---

## What it ain't

*(Trish)*

* Discussing a problem for 10+ minutes then splitting up and working on different parts
* Reviewing code after it's written
* Watching someone else code (and no other participation)
* Checking your email while someone else programs for you

---

## What it is

*(Daria)*

* You both know where you're starting and where you're heading
* You are both intellectually engaged
* You are both communicating while you pair (Driver and Navigator responsibility is split, not on one person)
* Either person can take over at any point (and you will be consistently switching)

# Ask us anything!

We're here to answer **your questions** about pair programming!

There are no stupid questions!

What follows are some topics we were thinking about while prepping

---

## Example questions

* How do you get over being nervous/insecure?
* When is it bad to pair?
* How do you deal with differing opinions?
* Is it easier to pair two very different people or two very similar people?
* How have you implemented remote pair programming?
* How did you get started pairing as a team?
* What's made pairing the most valuable?
* How do you decide when to go to the bathroom?

## Our tools

Specific to pairing:

* Amazon EC2
* Wemux (shared tmux)
* Vim
* Homesick (shared dotfiles)
* Hitch

## Why bother?

Isn't it a waste of time (and money) to have 2 people do the work of 1?

The answer: *time savings*

* **Stopping dumb mistakes.**  You can quickly fix something that would have taken 30 minutes to figure out.
* **A tighter code review cycle.**  Review code *as it's written*, not after days of work.  This results in more readable code.
* **Sharing is caring.** Best practices, shortcuts, problem solving strategies.
* **Transferring knowledge.**  More people know how the system works and why it works that way.
* **Better architecture.**  You tend to build to the highest common denominator, finding the best solution, and writing better code than either one of you could have written by yourself.
* **Fewer integration problems.**  If you switch partners often, then the entire team has a better chance of pulling the pieces together.  (The left hand knows what the right hand is doing.)
* **Team building.**  We love working on our team!  We have a lot of trust in each other.
* **Interruptions are less disruptive.**  The plan is understood by at least 2 people.
