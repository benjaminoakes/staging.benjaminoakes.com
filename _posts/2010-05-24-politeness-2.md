Sometimes Rubyists can be a little rude. To help fix that problem, I did what I do best: I wrote a Ruby script.

From the [GitHub repository](http://github.com/benjaminoakes/politeness):

> Require your Ruby code to be more polite: require &#8216;politeness&#8217;
>
> Inspired by INTERCAL, this library makes Ruby programmers say &#8220;please&#8221; more often. If Ruby doesn&#8217;t like how brash or cocky you&#8217;re being, it will stop in the middle of your code and tell you so:
>
> ```
> "Not polite enough!"
> ```
>
> However, you _can_ say please too much. In that case, Ruby will throw its hands up and tell you that you&#8217;re:
>
> ```
> "Too polite!"
> ```
>
> Most libraries are _very_ rude, so be sure to require politeness after including them (unless you intend to make them a little more well-mannered).
