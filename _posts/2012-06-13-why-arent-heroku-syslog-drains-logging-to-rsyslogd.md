From [a recent question I wrote](http://serverfault.com/questions/397724/why-arent-heroku-syslog-drains-logging-to-rsyslogd) on ServerFault:

> ## Question
> 
> I&#8217;m having a problem using syslog drains as described in <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/logging" rel="nofollow">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/logging</a>.
> 
> To summarize, I have an Ubuntu 10.04 instance on EC2 that is running `rsyslogd`. I&#8217;ve also set up the security groups as they describe, and added a syslog drain using a command like `heroku drains:add syslog://host1.example.com:514`.
> 
> I can send messages from the Heroku console to my `rsyslogd` instance via `nc`. I see them appear in the log file, so I know there isn&#8217;t a firewall/security group issue. Â However, Heroku does not seem to be forwarding log messages to the server that `heroku drains` lists. I would expect to see HTTP requests, Rails messages, etc.

> Is there something else I can try to do to figure this out? I&#8217;m new to `rsyslogd`, so I could easily be missing something.

>   * Port range: `514`
>   * Source: `098166147350/logplex` (NOTE: **not** `default`)
