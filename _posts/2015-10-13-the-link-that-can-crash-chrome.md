As far as I know, this is fixed now, but there&#8217;s a new one (in effect): [chrome://quit/](chrome://quit/)

Via the [TechCorridor.io](http://TechCorridor.io) Slack channel.

**Update 2018-01-20:** [chrome://quit/](chrome://quit/) doesn't work as a link anymore, but _does work_ if you type it into the address bar.
