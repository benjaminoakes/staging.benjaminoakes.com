[The Shut-In Economy — Matter — Medium](https://medium.com/matter/the-shut-in-economy-ec3ec1294816).

> And that&#8217;s when I realized: the on-demand world isn&#8217;t about sharing at all. It’s about being served. This is an economy of shut-ins.

A fascinating read, though I would be happy to know that it&#8217;s exaggerated.

I often hope that the Internet can help solve many of the social problems that we have as a society, but the more I see of its actual effects, all of these &#8220;social&#8221; apps and services are anything but socially-minded. It&#8217;s important to get out there in the real world and help make someone else&#8217;s life better!
