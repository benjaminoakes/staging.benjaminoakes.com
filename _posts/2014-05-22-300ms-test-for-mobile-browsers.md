[300ms test](http://jsbin.com/ONuQiZu/4/quiet).

Try it on Chrome for iOS vs Chrome for Android. ([Video](http://youtube.com/watch?v=AjUpiwvIa5A).) The former feels ridiculously slow by comparison. Same goes for Safari, even on iOS 7. When I talk about it being a problem that there&#8217;s only one browser engine (Apple&#8217;s version of WebKit) allowed on iOS, this is the type of problem I&#8217;m referring to.
