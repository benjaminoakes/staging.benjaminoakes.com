> No one is ever going to confuse McCormick Bacon Bits with “health” food, but what they lack in vital nutrients they make up for in taste. And they’re vegan! Smoky, crunchy, and salty, these fake-bacon bits taste great on baked and mashed potatoes, sprinkled over split-pea soup or corn chowder, tossed into salads, or as a tasty topping on your next slice of pizza.
