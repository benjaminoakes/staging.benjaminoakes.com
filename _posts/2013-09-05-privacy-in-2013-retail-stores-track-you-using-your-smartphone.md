[How Retail Stores Track You Using Your Smartphone (and How to Stop It)](http://lifehacker.com/how-retail-stores-track-you-using-your-smartphone-and-827512308).

I had figured brick-and-mortar stores would want to be able to do the same amount of massive digital tracking as Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc... but I hadn&#8217;t realized this was a way that it could be done. Basically, stores can keep track of a unique identifier ([MAC address](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address)) when your WiFi **passively** searches for a signal. This is **without** your involvement, as long as your device&#8217;s WiFi is on. It can be correlated with the security camera footage as well, automatically tracking your reactions to products as you walk around a store. Whoa.

That seems like it should need an _opt in_ rather than an _opt out_ (turning off WiFi, in this case). It&#8217;s not clear which stores do this or which plan to, but I would guess most major ones are at least considering it. The mall scene of [Minority Report](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Report_%28film%29) keeps getting closer and closer...
