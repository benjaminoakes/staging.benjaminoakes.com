[Hawaiian burger joint to open Aug. 18 in Iowa City - Corridor Business Journal](http://www.corridorbusiness.com/news/hawaiian-burger-joint-to-open-aug-18-in-iowa-city/)

Seems pretty interesting; I&#8217;ve been curious about it when I walk by.  It&#8217;s interesting that [Teddy&#8217;s Bigger Burgers](http://teddysbiggerburgers.com/) is only in a few places:  Hawaii, [Japan](http://tbbjapan.co.jp/web/), Washington, and now Iowa.  I skimmed through [their menu](http://teddysbiggerburgers.com/docs/Menu_English.pdf), and was happy to see they have vegetarian friendly fare alongside their kailua style and chili cheeseburgers.  Sounds worth a try.  :)
