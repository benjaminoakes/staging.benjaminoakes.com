From the comments:

> Funny how psychology works. I have no problem with Netflix using DRM, because it&#8217;s very clear that their offering is like a &#8220;channel&#8221;, to which you have unlimited access during the time you pay for the subscription.
> 
> On the other hand, I highly resent DRM in things like ebooks that I&#8217;ve paid for, because I&#8217;ve bought them and they should be MINE, perpetually. 

My thoughts, exactly.
