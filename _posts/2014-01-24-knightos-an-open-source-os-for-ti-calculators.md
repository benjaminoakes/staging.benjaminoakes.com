[KnightOS -- An open source OS for TI calculators](http://www.knightos.org/).

This seems like a strange thing to appear in 2014... an open source OS for TI calculators, [including the 83-plus that I used in high school](http://www.benjaminoakes.com/2010/08/08/basic-ti-83/ "Basic: TI-83").  It&#8217;s kind of amazing that this could even be created, but also a little disappointing that calculators have barely changed.  (I get the standardized-testing angle but... those black-and-white displays look like they&#8217;re a million years old.)

And of course, there&#8217;s a relevant XKCD:
