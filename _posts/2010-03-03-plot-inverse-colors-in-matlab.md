From [my question on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2372949/plot-inverse-colors-in-matlab) ([CC BY-SA 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)):

> I&#8217;m plotting on top of an image in Matlab. Sometimes, I can&#8217;t see what&#8217;s being plotted because the color of the image underneath is too close to the color of the image at the same location. I could just always change the color of the plot (e.g. from &#8216;rx&#8217; to &#8216;bx&#8217;), but that&#8217;s cumbersome.
