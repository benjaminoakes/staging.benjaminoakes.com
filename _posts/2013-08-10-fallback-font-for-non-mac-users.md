Recently [merged into MailView](https://github.com/37signals/mail_view/pull/42):

> Closes [#27](https://github.com/37signals/mail_view/issues/27)
> 
> Pretty simple: just add a fallback font family. Without this change, the headers (to, from, etc) are in Times New Roman on Linux, which looks really out of place.
> 
> Thanks for maintaining MailView!
