Matt Blair, Kyle Weis, Sarah Lefeber, and I attempted to make a sax quartet in 2003.  We practiced together a few times and I made these posters, but the group took a backseat to our involvement in the school's Jazz Band.

The name came from our initials (<strong>B</strong>lair, <strong>O</strong>akes, <strong>W</strong>eis, and <strong>L</strong>efeber) in case you didn't catch that.
