My review of [Stormcloud for Chrome](http://getstormcloud.com/):

> 4 out of 5 stars. Beautiful so far. Been wanting a trial [in the Ubuntu Software Center](https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/stormcloud/) as well, but I&#8217;ll take [the Chrome version](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stormcloud/jjpfchnjhjfiildkeelmdbkfkegkgehh). :)

> The preferences look nice but are hard to use. I wouldn&#8217;t have found out that I had to click the &#8220;check&#8221; next to my newly-added city to get it to stick if I hadn&#8217;t read it on [a blog post](http://www.omgchrome.com/stormcloud-for-chrome-weather-made-beautiful/). That needs a fix ASAP, as I&#8217;m not the only one running into it!
