[Why Wesabe Lost to Mint -- Marc Hedlund&#8217;s Blog](http://blog.precipice.org/why-wesabe-lost-to-mint/).

I&#8217;ve come across this blog post a number of times, and it always makes me think. (Wesabe is also notable for having [open sourced their code after failing](https://github.com/wesabe/), though it hasn&#8217;t gotten much continued development.) Regardless, more companies should share stories like these so others can learn from them.

From the post:

> Mint focused on making the user do almost no work at all, by automatically editing and categorizing their data, reducing the number of fields in their signup form, and giving them immediate gratification as soon as they possibly could; we completely sucked at all of that. Instead, I prioritized trying to build tools that would eventually help people change their financial behavior for the better, which I believed required people to more closely work with and understand their data. My goals may have been (okay, were) noble, but in the end we didn’t help the people I wanted to since the product failed. I was focused on trying to make the usability of editing data as easy and functional as it could be; Mint was focused on making it so you never had to do that at all. Their approach completely kicked our approach’s ass. (To be defensive for just a moment, their data accuracy – how well they automatically edited – was really low, and anyone who looked deeply into their data at Mint, especially in the beginning, was shocked at how inaccurate it was. The point, though, is hardly anyone seems to have looked.)
