[Let Me Explain Why Miley Cyrusâ€™ VMA Performance Was Our Top Story This Morning &#8211; The Onion](http://www.theonion.com/articles/let-me-explain-why-miley-cyrus-vma-performance-was,33632/).

That&#8217;s the Onion telling CNN how to be a respectable news organization. The **Onion**, the fake news site. What&#8217;s happened to journalism? If the only thing you care about is metrics like page views, you can easily be led astray. This really shouldn&#8217;t have been bigger news than Syria or the anniversary of the &#8220;I Have a Dream&#8221; speech. This isn&#8217;t the first time CNN has done something like this, either.
