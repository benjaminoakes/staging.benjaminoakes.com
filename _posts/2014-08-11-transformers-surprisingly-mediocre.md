From <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H171NJKLEW68" target="_blank">my 3-star review posted on Amazon</a>:

> I expected better, especially from the writers. It&#8217;s not bad, but I don&#8217;t have any desire to see it again.
> 
> It&#8217;s essentially The Avengers, but with robots, crude humor, and many fighting scenes that seemed to go on longer than they should. It&#8217;s a good movie if you just want to watch a somewhat-mindless action flick for 2.5 hours, or if you&#8217;re a bigger fan of the cartoon than I was as a kid.
