[Switching from Gmail to FastMail â€“ Max Masnick](http://www.maxmasnick.com/2013/07/19/fastmail/).

Not sure if I&#8217;d ever switch from Gmail, but if I did, FastMail seems like a good (though paid) solution. Although it&#8217;s still unlikely that Gmail would drop IMAP support (and thus any way of exporting email), this would be a service to consider as an alternative if a decision to drop IMAP should happen. Since Google is dropping XMPP support for their chat service and already killed their RSS reader, who knows where the next 4 years might take us...
