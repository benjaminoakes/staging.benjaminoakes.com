From [the Meetup event](http://www.meetup.com/icruby/events/220504938/):

> Joe Seeley will be giving an informal talk on [Artoo](http://artoo.io/), &#8220;a Ruby framework for robots, physical computing, and the Internet of Things.&#8221;Â  He&#8217;ll be bringing his [Sphero](http://www.gosphero.com/) and show us a couple of basic samples.
