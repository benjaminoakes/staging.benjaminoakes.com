[YouTube says HTML5 video ready for primetime, makes it default - Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/01/youtube-declares-html5-video-ready-for-primetime-makes-it-default/).

Finally. I&#8217;m glad to hear VP9 (an open source video codec) is still a big part of their HTML5 plans. I&#8217;m curious to see how the percentage of DRM content on YouTube changes with EME (Encrypted Media Extensions) becoming more widely supported in browsers. But hey, if having EME means we that [we have official support for Netflix on Ubuntu](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2014/10/psa-netflix-ubuntu-now-working-box), it&#8217;s not all bad news.
