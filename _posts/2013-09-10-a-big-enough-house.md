[The 400-square-foot dream home](http://realestate.msn.com/article.aspx?cp-documentid=13107727).

Given a choice between consumerism and minimalism, I often tend towards the latter. Although I don&#8217;t think I could ever live in a small home unless I were a bachelor, there&#8217;s something about an Anti-McMansion homes that&#8217;s in line with my way of thinking. You&#8217;d only ever keep essentials in a 400 square-foot home. You just wouldn&#8217;t have room for anything else.

A number of Iowa Citians seem to feel the same way, including some people I know, as well as the subject of the [linked article](http://realestate.msn.com/article.aspx?cp-documentid=13107727). It&#8217;s nice when [Iowa City](http://www.benjaminoakes.com/category/iowa-city/) is in the news for all the little quirks that make it great.

Am I planning to own a small home? No, but I think we&#8217;ll have a &#8220;big-enough house&#8221;. There are many forms of minimalism. It doesn&#8217;t mean that you give everything up, just that you get rid of extraneous things. Is that something I do well? Sometimes. Sometimes not.

If nothing else, reading blogs like [Leo Babauta&#8217;s mnmlist](http://mnmlist.com/) was really helpful when we [moved across the country](http://www.benjaminoakes.com/2013/08/30/moving-across-half-the-country/). We got rid of everything that we could, and have only replaced what we really missed. Could we still get rid of more? Probably. Gaining clutter can still be a problem, but if you&#8217;re honest with yourself, you can declutter too.
