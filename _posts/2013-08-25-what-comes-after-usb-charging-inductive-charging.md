[Qi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi_(inductive_power_standard)) is an inductive power standard that seems like it might start to take off. Compatible devices can use it to charge by simply coming into contact with a charger, such as a charging mat. While the [2013 Nexus 7](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_7_2013) has it built in, the [2012 Nexus 7](http://www.benjaminoakes.com/2013/02/11/is-an-ipad-mini-or-a-nexus-7-better-for-a-geek/) does not.

I still wonder about the safety, but it would definitely be convenient! It&#8217;s exciting to think that newer devices will start to build in this technology.
