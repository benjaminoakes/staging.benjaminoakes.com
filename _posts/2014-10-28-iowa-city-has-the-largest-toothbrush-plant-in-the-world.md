[Manual Toothbrush Built In the USA - Oral B](http://www.oralb.com/oralbusa).

> Oral-B&#8217;s Iowa City plant is the largest toothbrush plant in the world. Approximately 1 million Oral-B manual toothbrushes are built at the plant by nearly 500 hardworking, committed people, including U.S. Veterans.

Makes sense, but I didn&#8217;t know it was the biggest.
