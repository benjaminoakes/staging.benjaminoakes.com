Escape from callback hell in JavaScript, but with cancellation. Excellent visualizations. 

Example code:

    export default Ember.Component.extend({<br clear="none"></br>
    Â  myTask: task(waitAMoment).drop(),<br clear="none"></br>
    });<br clear="none"></br>
    
    

Also interesting: `enqueue`
