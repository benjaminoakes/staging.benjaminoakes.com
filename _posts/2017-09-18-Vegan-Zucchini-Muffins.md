Ingredients:

  * 1 cup all-purpose flour
  * 1/4 teaspoon salt
  * 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
  * 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
  * 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
  * 1 1/2 teaspoons egg replacer
  * 1/2 cup brown sugar
  * 1/4 cup apple sauce
  * 1 1/4 cup shredded zucchini
  * 1/4 cup walnuts
  * 2-4 tablespoons water

Directions:

  * Combine ingredients in a bowl.  Stir well.
  * Spray muffin tin with vegetable oil to prevent sticking.  (Between this and a non-stick muffin tin, I haven't found paper liners to be necessary.)
  * Divide batter into 12 muffin cups (about 2/3 full).
  * Bake at 350&deg;F for 25 minutes.
