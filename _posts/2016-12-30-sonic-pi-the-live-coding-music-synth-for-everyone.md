> The goal of these articles is to explore the relationships between music and code, by analyzing and recreating the track Aerodynamic from Daft Punk.
> 
> Unlike classical approaches to generate sound on a computer, we are going to generate sound by writing text: instead of adding tracks, instruments, samples… on a timeline, we will see how to express those in code and how to play music.

> OSC-over-UDP is just OSC packed data sent over a UDP connection. My first serious encounter with OSC-over-UDP was when I attended strangloop and talked about The Mess We&#8217;re In

> 
> Sam told me that to control Sonic Pi all I had to do was send it OSC encoded messages over UDP.
