These are some interesting posts I found around the web this week, along with some commentary from me. You can [check out last week&#8217;s roundup](http://www.benjaminoakes.com/2013/04/14/weekly-roundup/) too. :)

  * **<a target="_blank" href="http://www.siliconprairienews.com/2013/04/four-part-series-shares-story-of-guitar-hero-s-iowa-roots?utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+siliconprairienews%2Fnational+%28Silicon+Prairie+News+-+National%29">Four-part series shares story of Guitar Hero's Iowa roots</a>** &mdash; I had always been curious about Budcat, especially as an Iowa City company that made something so recognizable. Sad that it ended without warning, but I&#8217;m hopeful for what the former team members have made since then, especially the Ouya game.
  * **<a target="_blank" href="http://lifehacker.com/top-10-awesome-macgyver-tricks-that-speak-for-themselve-476433796">Top 10 Awesome MacGyver Tricks That Speak For Themselves</a>** &mdash; I really want to try sealing a plastic bag with an old bottle cap, and the cable catchers.
  * **<a target="_blank" href="http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2013/04/16/three-big-tips-for-inexpensive-spring-allergy-relief/?utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+thesimpledollar+%28The+Simple+Dollar%29">Three Big Tips for Inexpensive Spring Allergy Relief</a>** &mdash; Generics are always a good choice to consider, plus the other tips.
  * **<a target="_blank" href="http://liliputing.com/2013/04/geeksphone-keon-firefox-os-phone-hits-the-fcc-user-manual-included.html?utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Liliputing+%28Liliputing%29">Geeksphone Keon Firefox OS phone hits the FCC, user manual included</a>** &mdash; Although I&#8217;m not sure how it will do in the American market, a phone &#8220;built of the web&#8221; is still very intriguing. I hope it catches on (and is installable on Android-based hardware).
  * **<a target="_blank" href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/04/it-just-works-dell-xps-13-developer-edition-linux-ultrabook-review/">It just works: Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition Linux Ultrabook review</a>** &mdash; I&#8217;m happy to hear Dell is being a good member of the open source community; I had chosen [System 76](https://www.system76.com/) instead because of what I had heard aobut Dell in the past. I&#8217;d really like to see Ubuntu catch on as a desktop for developers, and it&#8217;s great to see this as a realistic, well supported option. If only the hardware could be configured (maybe 4GB RAM instead of 8?).
  * **<a target="_blank" href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/04/canonical-ditching-ubuntu-cdsdvds-for-non-lts?utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+d0od+%28OMG%21+Ubuntu%21%29">Canonical Axe Ubuntu Discs for Non-LTS Releases</a>** &mdash; Kind of sad; I wish I had one of the older discs as a collector&#8217;s item. Hard to believe they used to ship them for free.
  * **<a target="_blank" href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/04/new-ubuntu-13-04-features?utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+d0od+%28OMG%21+Ubuntu%21%29">10 Best Ubuntu 13.04 Features â€“ From Social Lens to Window Snapping</a>** &mdash; More an incremental release than anything, but in good ways. I&#8217;m happy about the performance improvements; it&#8217;s noticeable on my machine in the beta.
  * **<a target="_blank" href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/04/apple-remembers-where-you-wanted-to-get-drunk-for-up-to-2-years/">Apple remembers where you wanted to get drunk for up to 2 years</a>** &mdash; Creepy. This type of thing should stay on your phone, in my opinion.
  * **<a target="_blank" href="http://liliputing.com/2013/04/ouya-99-android-game-console-gets-the-fcc-teardown-treatment.html?utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Liliputing+%28Liliputing%29">Ouya $99 Android game console gets the FCC teardown treatment</a>** &mdash; I&#8217;m really hopeful for the Ouya. Here&#8217;s hoping openness makes it a winner, and that great games really make it catch on.
  * **<a target="_blank" href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/249951/if_it_aint_broke_dont_fix_it_ancient_computers_in_use_today.html">Lilbits (4-17-2013): Old computers never go out of style</a>** &mdash; Too many people throw out old computers, rather than repurposing them. Although many of these are ancient by many people&#8217;s standards, I think it&#8217;s worth remembering that you don&#8217;t need the fastest machine on the block to do useful work.
  * **<a target="_blank" href="http://liliputing.com/2013/04/lilbits-4-16-2013-netflix-to-go-html5-xiaomi-to-go-international.html?utm_source=feedburner&#038;utmmedium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Liliputing+%28Liliputing%29">Lilbits (4-16-2013): Netflix to go HTML5, Xiaomi to go international</a>** &mdash; Finally Netflix isn&#8217;t dependent on Silverlight, although increased DRM in browsers isn&#8217;t a great development for consumers&#8230;
  * **<a target="_blank" href="http://blog.izs.me/post/48281998870/unix-philosophy-and-node-js?utm_source=javascriptweekly&#038;utm_medium=email">blog.izs.me: Unix Philosophy and Node.js</a>** &mdash; I&#8217;ve never felt that Node.js has ever embraced Unix as much as Ruby has, but this article made me rethink what the Unix philosophy means in practice.
