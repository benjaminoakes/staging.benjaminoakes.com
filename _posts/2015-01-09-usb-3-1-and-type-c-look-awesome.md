[USB 3.1 and Type-C: The only stuff at CES that everyone is going to use - Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/01/usb-3-1-and-type-c-the-only-stuff-at-ces-that-everyone-is-going-to-use/).

I&#8217;ve seen the future, and it&#8217;s full of USB.

Seriously, 100W of power, 10Gbps of data, and a reversible connection? So great.

I&#8217;m looking forward to a USB powered laptop that plugs into a monitor over the same kind of cable.
