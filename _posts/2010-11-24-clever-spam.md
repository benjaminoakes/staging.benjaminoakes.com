I got this spam email at my old [university](http://www.uiowa.edu/) address today. I thought it was pretty clever (it definitely had me chuckling). Much too long for a tweet, so here it is:

> DEAR RECEIVER,
> 
> You have just received a Taliban virus. Since we are not so technologicaly advanced in Afghanistan, this is a MANUAL virus. Please delete all the files on your hard disk yourself and send this mail to everyone you know.
> 
> Thank you very much for helping us.
> 
> Thanks & Regard&#8217;s
