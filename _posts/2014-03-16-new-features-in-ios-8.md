[iOS 8 to gain at least five new first-party apps - ZDNet](http://www.zdnet.com/ios-8-to-gain-at-least-five-new-first-party-apps-7000027342/).

[iOS 8: Apple works to further push iCloud as the future of the file system](http://9to5mac.com/2014/03/13/ios-8-apple-works-to-further-push-icloud-as-the-future-of-the-ios-file-system/).

Like Jason O&#8217;Grady, I have a list of iOS features on my wishlist that could keep me on the platform past iOS 7.1.

Apple made changes in iOS 7 which addressed my earlier criticisms, namely:

  * Control Center
  * &#8220;Today&#8221; view in Notification Center
  * Better multitasking UI
  * A refreshed UI

Maybe iOS 8 will address some of my concerns with iOS as well. I&#8217;ve divided my list into categories:

Likely:

  * Better data sharing experience, rather than a few promoted services like Facebook, Flickr, and Twitter.
  * Allow me to completely disable Game Center. I have stopped using many casual games because they pop up Game Center every time I open them.

Possible:

  * Default apps. I should be able to make Chrome my default browser and Gmail my default email client if I want to.
  * Make FaceTime audio automatic, like iMessage.
  * More intelligent weather notices via notifications.
  * Landscape springboard on the iPhone. I was sure this was coming after using it on an iPad, but it&#8217;s been absent for years.

Unlikely:

  * Better background APIs (e.g. so Dropbox can backup my photos without a location-checking hack)
  * Multiple user accounts. Many apps allow multiple accounts, but if I want to switch my iPhone to &#8220;work mode&#8221; during the day, it&#8217;s a pain compared to Android.
  * Someplace to keep installed apps other than the home screen. Android solves this with an &#8220;app drawer&#8221;.

Very unlikely:

  * Allow 3rd party browsers like Chrome and Firefox in the App Store. (Chrome for iOS is just a skin on Safari.)
  * Allow applications to be installed from outside of the App Store if a setting is changed, like OSX and Android.
  * An service to move my paid iTunes purchases to another service such as Google Play or Amazon. Right now, my purchased DRM-locked media from iTunes is only playable on an Apple device. A cross-platform &#8220;iTunes Video&#8221; app would be another option.
  * A less app-centric iCloud. Until I can combine files for a single project in a folder like Dropbox or Google Drive, iCloud seems fairly useless for me. I currently only use it for backup and &#8220;find my device&#8221;.

Unfortunately, most of my wishlist is unlikely to be addressed in iOS 8. Although I&#8217;ve been invested in iOS since 2008 (back at version 2), my impression is that the only way to get what&#8217;s on my wishlist would be to switch to another platform. I&#8217;m curious to see what iOS 8 brings in June.
