[Your late fees are waived: Blockbuster closes -- CNN.com](http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/06/tech/gaming-gadgets/blockbuster-video-stores-impact/).

Not surprising, but still something worth reflecting on. Strange to think that so many video rental stores are disappearing (along with the jobs they provided), but at least there won&#8217;t be millions of plastic disks getting created because of digital distribution.

I thought this was really funny. I&#8217;m disappointed though; Iowa City never had a Borders that I&#8217;m aware of. (Although I really miss the one in Omaha, it seems to have been the only Borders worth shopping at in my experience.) Anyway, I&#8217;m looking forward to visiting future Iowa City&#8217;s Borders Bookstore Museum.
