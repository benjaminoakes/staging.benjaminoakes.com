today the laugh olympics were held. it shorted classes, which was good for everyone, and people got to cover the principle&#8217;s and vice-principle&#8217;s faces with pies. some of it turned out to be pretty hilarious. it was set up so each grade was a team, but all the events were leaned in favor of the seniors. go figure&#8230; in any case, it&#8217;s good that school is getting out in only a few weeks!
