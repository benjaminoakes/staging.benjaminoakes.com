[Why Linux | Virtuous Code](http://devblog.avdi.org/2011/08/09/why-linux/).

Avdi has a pretty similar story to me. I was [a big fan of the BeOS back in the day](http://www.benjaminoakes.com/2004/08/16/nostalgia/), which got me involved with the POSIX command line (`bash` specifically). That led to OS X and eventually to Linux. I use Ubuntu for most things today.

Avdi&#8217;s feelings on OS X package management are similar to mine&#8230; I used OS X long enough to have used Fink, MacPorts, and Homebrew myself. I started to give up on OS X after I realized that Apple would never make a &#8220;blessed&#8221; package manager, especially after the Mac App Store came to be. (It&#8217;s interesting to note that Debian packages have been fairly constant compared to the short, tumultuous history of OS X package management.)
