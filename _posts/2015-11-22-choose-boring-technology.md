> Let&#8217;s say every company gets about three innovation tokens. You can spend these however you want, but the supply is fixed for a long while. You might get a few more after you achieve a certain level of stability and maturity, but the general tendency is to overestimate the contents of your wallet. Clearly this model is approximate, but I think it helps.

If you choose to use service discovery tech that&#8217;s existed for a year or less, you just spent one of your innovation tokens. If you choose to write your own database, oh god, you&#8217;re in trouble.

The <a href="http://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology-slides" target="_blank">slides</a> are good too. This isn&#8217;t to say Node.js or Ruby are bad choices, but rather &#8220;don&#8217;t add new tech just because it&#8217;s shiny.&#8221;
