[For the first time, the world economy grows while carbon emissions don't | The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/13/8211817/carbon-dioxide-emissions-world-economy-link).

> New data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) is showing that last year, for the first time in four decades, global CO2 emissions have &#8220;stalled,&#8221; remaining at about 32 billion tonnes, the same number as in 2013. &#8220;This is both a very welcome surprise and a significant one,&#8221; said IEA Chief Economist Fatih Birol. &#8220;It provides much-needed momentum to negotiators preparing to forge a global climate deal in Paris in December: for the first time, greenhouse gas emissions are decoupling from economic growth.&#8221; 

All this means is the bathtub isn&#8217;t filling up quite as quickly, but it&#8217;s a good sign nevertheless. Let&#8217;s make 2015 the first year that the rate goes down.
