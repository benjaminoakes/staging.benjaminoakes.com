From [my review posted on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/review/R40RVVMRZ21NN/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LWZWFQ&linkCode=&nodeID=&tag=):

> I generally liked it, but almost stopped watching halfway through. This movie wasn&#8217;t original or interesting enough for me to want to see it again. Peter Parker didn&#8217;t feel like Peter Parker. While that could be okay, it felt like the character wasn&#8217;t developed as much as he needed to be. Maybe I just prefer the first Spider-Man film... but I don&#8217;t think this one deserves a 5 star review like some others have given it.
