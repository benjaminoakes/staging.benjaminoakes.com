I must say I was surprised to see [this](http://www.coachbladt.com/).

For those of you who don&#8217;t know, our much-beloved football coach, Coach Bladt, has been hospitalized. For more details you can view his [website](http://www.coachbladt.com/), of course.

Really, I hadn&#8217;t grasped the severity of the situation, but it&#8217;s starting to come into view. Please recover soon, Mr. Bladt. We&#8217;re counting on you for our third straight football state championship! How can I make that not sound pompous without using smilies?
