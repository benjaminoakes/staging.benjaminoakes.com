I recently got a DRM-free download of [_Primer_](http://erbpfilm.com/film/primer), a great low-budget indie sci-fi film.  I was happy to find out that [VHX](http://www.vhx.tv/) offers DRM-free video downloads as a service, connecting content creators directly with their customers.  They currently have a handful of films, but recognizable names like [Aziz Ansari](http://azizansari.com/), [This American Life](http://live.thisamericanlife.org/), and [Upstream Color](http://erbpfilm.com/film/upstreamcolor) (from the creator of _Primer_).

I can definitely understand DRM on video **rentals** (like Netflix), but my feeling is that if I **purchase** an MP4 file, I should be able to play that MP4 file on MP4-compatible player, regardless of manufacturer.  That&#8217;s what DRM-free gives you, so I&#8217;m happy to hear VHX exists.  Ideally, it&#8217;s the way more video content gets delivered in the future.
