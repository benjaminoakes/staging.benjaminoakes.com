Looking for DRM free books on Google Play that you can use on any EPUB eReader, like a Nook or iPad?  They can be a great deal in combination with a $5 off coupon that Google sometimes offers.  Unfortunately, Google makes searching for DRM free (or price) difficult.

Here are some options I found while looking for DRM free books.

Publishers:

* Tor books
* O'Reilly Media
* Packt Publishing
* No Starch Press

Additionally, Macmillan, Forge Books, and Forbes seem to have a handful of DRM free titles. Check the product details for "Content Protection: This content is DRM free."  It's always near the bottom of the product details. 

You can also search for "this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management software". (Hat tip to [Dan Scott](https://coffeecode.net/finding-drm-free-books-on-the-google-play-store.html).)
