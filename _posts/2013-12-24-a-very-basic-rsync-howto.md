[A very basic rsync HOWTO TransAMrit.net](http://transamrit.net/docs/rsync/).

I found this useful when setting up `rsync` for backups on a low-resource, headless Linux box. It was especially nice because it had a simple writeup for `inetd` which can be a better choice when you only connect to the `rsync` server a handful of times a day.
