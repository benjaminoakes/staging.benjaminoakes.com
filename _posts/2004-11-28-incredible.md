We don&#8217;t have a big family around here. For Thanksgiving, it&#8217;s usually just my sister, my mom, and I. Usually, we don&#8217;t bother making a turkey. That would be more than a little too much food. It probably doesn&#8217;t help that I&#8217;m a vegetarian. 

So, the tradition is to go to a casino in Council Bluffs and eat the buffet. No dirty plates, no cooking, just eating, family, and enjoyment. After that, we usually go see a movie. 

I really wanted to see <cite><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/universal/ray/">Ray</a></cite>, as did my mom. However, my sister doesn&#8217;t even know that [Ray Charles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Charles) is a musician. Obviously we made a compromise. They both wanted to see National Treasure. You&#8217;d have to drag me screaming to see that. Maybe not screaming, but I definitely would have to be forced. 

We settled on <cite><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/disney/the_incredibles/">The Incredibles</a></cite>. It&#8217;s a Pixar flick, and, likewise, I knew I would probably enjoy it. That was an understatement. It was very good and worth my time. (I&#8217;m trying to avoid using the word &#8220;incredible.&#8221; Honest!) 

At the expense of being overly analytical, I&#8217;m going to tell you why I liked it so much. 

First of all, because it is a cartoon, the characters are not proportional. This adds to the humor immensly, especially when Mr. Incredible is in his cubicle (view the [trailers](http://www.apple.com/trailers/disney/the_incredibles/) to see what I mean). The man is so huge and powerful, everything else around him is dwarfed. The timing of the characters actions contribute to the feel well; obviously very well directed. 

I personally love the music. It was big band Jazz during most of the movie, giving a great underlying feel of energy and excitement. By the way, in the trailers they use the Propellerheads&#8217; song called &#8220;<a name="disc_1">On Her Majesty&#8217;s Secret Service&#8221; on the CD </a>[Decksanddrumsandrockandroll](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000006BZ5/qid=1101666727/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1/102-2934666-0781714), one of my favorite songs of theirs. I recognized it instantly; a very good choice. 

I could go on and on about this movie, and some time in the future I might. But as of yet, I still need to work on homework and stop blogging. If you can read Spanish, here&#8217;s an email I wrote partially about the movie: 

> Querida Señora, 
> 
> ¡Ay, olvidé! Fue el pavo, te digo, ¡el pavo! Me duerme fácilmente&#8230; 
> 
> Esto fue un mentira. No pudo el pavo porque soy un vegetariano. No sé que fue, entonces&#8230; Tal vez porque soy tanto. 
> 
> ¿Disfrutó usted el día de gracias? Lo disfruté. Porque hay solamente tres personas en esta familia (y un no come pavo), nosotros usualmente vamos a un casino (Ameristar, Harrah&#8217;s) y comemos su buffet. Es siempre agradable; no platos sucios, no trabajo dificíl haciendo la comida, y después de la cena&#8230; ¡Nosotros vamos a una película! No hay mucho de elegir, no obstante. Quise mirar &#8220;Ray,&#8221; la película sobre el músico quien, tristemente, murió, pero mi hermana no sabe quien él fue. Así, nosotros miramos &#8220;The Incredibles.&#8221; Es un película por los niños, pero lo disfruté.

    Loved Lady, Ay, I forgot! It was the turkey, I say to you, the turkey! To duer to me easily to me&#8230; This was a lie. The turkey could not because I am a vegetarian. I do not know that it was, then&#8230; Perhaps because I am as much. Enjoyed you the day of thanks? I enjoyed it. Because there are only three people in this family (and he does not eat turkey), we usually go to a casino (Ameristar, Harrah&#8217;s) and eat their buffet. He is always pleasant; dirty nonplates, work dificíl not making the food, and after the supper&#8230; We go to a film! There is much no to choose, despite. I wanted to watch &#8220;Ray, &#8221; the film on the musician who, sadly, died, but my sister does not know who he was. Thus, we watched &#8220;The Incredibles.&#8221; It is a film by the children, but I enjoyed it. I know that I am not only who forgot to write a letter. Ah, the holiday days&#8230; Its student, <strong>Horseradish tree Oakes</strong>
