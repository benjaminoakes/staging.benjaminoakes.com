Today&#8217;s been shaping up pretty well.  I actually woke up at a decent time.  The last few days, I&#8217;ve been enjoying sleeping until noon, but today I was up and about at nine.  Not at night either, nine this morning!

I&#8217;ve been getting _tons_ done with this new laptop.  I&#8217;ve spent most of the week moving files from other computers to this new one.  At this point, I have most of my personal files all in one place.  Believe it or not, that&#8217;s a truly gratifying experience.  And now, I can have an extra copy of all these files on me at all times, thanks to the [USB JumpDrive](http://www.lexar.com/jumpdrive/jd_secure.html) I received for my birthday.

    However, there was one thing that made the day great.  I finally received my ACT scores.  I&#8217;m not going to say what I got, but I <em>will </em>say that I solidly qualify for all the scholarships that require at least a 30.</p>

      And that&#8217;s not all: earlier this afternoon I got my car washed.  I paid for a regular automatic wash&#8211;no wax, no dryer&#8211;but I received both of these free.  I asked the manger if he wanted me to pay extra, but he said it wasn&#8217;t necessary after thanking me.

      Let&#8217;s hope things go as well next year!  Happy New Year everybody!
