From [my question on the ruby-talk mailing list](http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/293561):

> I&#8217;m interested in doing sound processing in Ruby. I&#8217;ve found some good libraries for Python, but haven&#8217;t been able to find anything very mature for Ruby (which I would prefer to work with, since I don&#8217;t know Python nearly as well). Anything I&#8217;ve found on RubyForge, for example, is in alpha. (I did find &#8216;ruby/audio&#8217; but it I haven&#8217;t had much luck with it so far, without any type of guide.) Can anyone point me to some resources? I haven&#8217;t been able to find much of anything via Google so far.
