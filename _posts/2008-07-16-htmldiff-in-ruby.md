I ran into a problem using the HTMLDiff code found in [i2](http://dev.rubyonrails.org/browser/tools/i2/trunk/vendor/html_diff/lib/html_diff.rb) for doing nice diffs in Ruby. Of course, you&#8217;ll probably want to use in Rails, but if you are running Rails 2.1 (or maybe even other versions), you&#8217;ll want to use an [updated version](http://www.mypoint.se/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/html_diff.rb) instead.

**Update:** It looks like this HTMLDiff code is no longer available at the provided links. I think I still have a copy somewhere, let me know if you need it by leaving a comment.
