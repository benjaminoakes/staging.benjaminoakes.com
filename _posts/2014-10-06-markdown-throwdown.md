My comment on [the Ars Technica article](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/10/markdown-throwdown-what-happens-when-foss-software-gets-corporate-backing/):

> All things considered, I&#8217;d rather have companies like GitHub, StackOverflow, and reddit push for an improved open standard than let Markdown continue to languish. Compared to some other companies on the web, those 3 don&#8217;t seem like bad apples at all -- but having clearer community involvement wouldn&#8217;t hurt.

> I&#8217;m totally on board for a name change though, and a bit surprised Atwood didn&#8217;t push for that. Something simple, say &#8220;Discount&#8221; (or another play on the word Markdown). 

At the time of this writing, it has a score of 74 votes, making it a reader favorite for the article -- which was a nice surprise. :)
