I&#8217;ve been battling automated emails from `cron` for years, but I never knew there was a word for `cron` spam. It&#8217;s &#8220;cram&#8221;, which also happens to be my new favorite word.

Truly, `cron`&#8216;s best feature (emailing output) is its worst feature too. Perhaps [Cronic](http://habilis.net/cronic/) can help&#8230;
