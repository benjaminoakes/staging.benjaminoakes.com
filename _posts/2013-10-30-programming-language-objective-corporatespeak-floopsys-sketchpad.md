[Programming Language: Objective CorporateSpeak++ -- Floopsy&#8217;s Sketchpad](http://www.floopsy.com/post/32660494624/programming-language-objective-corporatespeak).

Business speak and programming languages, mixed together...   Funny if you&#8217;ve ever spent time in either world..

From the page:

> Inspired by the constant corporate speak I have had the pleasure of hearing, I have undertaken the arduos task of developing the next generation of programming language:
> 
> **Objective CorporateSpeak++**
> 
> In this essay, I will demonstrate the usage of some of the programming idioms:
> 
> _**Classes**_
> 
>     Value-Added Class Foo {
>       Private Value-Added String Name;
>     
>       Public Mission Critical Function sayName( Value-Added String Name) {
>         System.Out_of_The_Box.Println(“Hello {}”, Name)
>       }
>     }
