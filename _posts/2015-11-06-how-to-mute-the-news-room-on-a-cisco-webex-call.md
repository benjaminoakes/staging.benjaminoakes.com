WebEx has a feature that plays the news while you wait for the meeting organizer to arrive. It&#8217;s a nice idea in theory, but it can make it difficult to, say, write an email while you wait.

To mute the news feed, this is all you need to do:

  * Wait until you hear the news feed and then...
  * Hit `*60` **quickly** (`*6` is used for some other functions, which is why the numbers need to be entered rapidly)

The news feed will mute and you will then hear silence.
