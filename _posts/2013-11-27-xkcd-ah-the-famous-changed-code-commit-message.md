[![XKCD #1296: Git Commit](http://www.benjaminoakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/git_commit.png)](http://xkcd.com/1296/)

(via [XKCD](http://xkcd.com/license.html))

So true! But pair programming can help with that. :)

In real life though... I sometimes use the commit message &#8220;(m)&#8221; when I only changed whitespace or a comment, etc. it&#8217;s a lot easier than writing a description that&#8217;s longer than the change itself.
