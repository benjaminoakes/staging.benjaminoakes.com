From [my question on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1875305/command-line-csv-viewer) ([CC BY-SA 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)):

> Anyone know of a command-line CSV viewer for Linux/OS X? I&#8217;m thinking of something like `less` but that spaces out the columns in a more readable way. (I&#8217;d be fine with opening it with OpenOffice Calc or Excel, but that&#8217;s way too overpowered for just _looking_ at the data like I need to.) Having horizontal and vertical scrolling would be great.
