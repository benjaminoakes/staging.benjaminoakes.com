[LXC provider for Vagrant – Fábio Rehm](http://fabiorehm.com/blog/2013/04/28/lxc-provider-for-vagrant/).

Vagrant-LXC seems really nice. It uses Linux containers instead of VirtualBox, VMWare, etc (which only works if you have a Linux host, of course). It&#8217;s much more lightweight than a virtual machine, so it&#8217;s much faster.
