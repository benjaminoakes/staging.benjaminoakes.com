I had a great time today at the [Creative Corridor](http://creativecorridor.co/) Launch. I was really impressed by the number of people there (approx 300), and the event itself. I&#8217;m really for the idea of presenting this region in a better light. Like many Iowans, I&#8217;ve heard plenty of corn jokes, etc. when traveling and living elsewhere. There are too many amazing people living here for that to be the only impression Iowa leaves. Let&#8217;s fix that!

My favorite quote from the event: &#8220;not only do we **create** here, we are also creating **here**&#8220;.
  
The Creative Corridor is what we make of it, after all, so let&#8217;s make the most of it.

Below is a video they presented at the event, which I think turned out very well. Here&#8217;s hoping it helps de-mystify Iowa to those living outside the Midwest!
