Here are the photos of me with Jerry, as promised:

![Jerry sees me walking over to him](http://media.benjaminoakes.com/2004/Fan Club/jerry1.jpg)

That&#8217;s me on the far left and Jerry&#8217;s on the right.

It&#8217;s still spooky how similar our shirts were...

Someone decided that we could look even **more** alike if I would wear a hat.

If you have no idea what these photos are about, feel free to look at [the previous post](/2004/09/18/i-have-a-fan-club/). Again, a reminder to visit his band&#8217;s [web site](http://www.backroadsrocks.com/). There&#8217;s even some mp3 clips if you fancy.

**Update:** Their site is no longer around. I still have the CD, so I might see if I can post a couple of mp3s up here with their permission.
