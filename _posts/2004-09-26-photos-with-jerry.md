If you have no idea what these photos are about, feel free to look at [the previous post](/2004/09/18/i-have-a-fan-club/). Again, a reminder to visit his band&#8217;s [web site](http://www.backroadsrocks.com/). There&#8217;s even some mp3 clips if you fancy. 

**Update:** Their site is no longer around. I still have the CD, so I might see if I can post a couple of mp3s up here with their permission.
