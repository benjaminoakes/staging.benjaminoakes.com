> Traditional roguelike game with pixel-art graphics and simple interface.

I randomly came across Pixel Dungeon today, and it was well timed because I was recently thinking about re-playing [Diablo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_%28video_game%29), a very well known take on the &#8220;rougelike&#8221; concept. However, though I kept thinking it would better on a tablet. (I played it a little on a Windows XP tablet. Yes, there was such a thing, and I had one... though I didn&#8217;t have the time to sit down and enjoy it back then.) Unfortunately, Diablo isn&#8217;t on Android, and from what I can tell, it&#8217;s not worth the trouble of trying to get the Windows 95 version up and running under emulation.

I found [NetHack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetHack), famous for being one of the oldest continually developed games, which has some okay Android ports with some okay tilesets. I was hoping for NetHack with higher fidelity, maybe some retro-styled graphics, maybe some sound effects, and if I was lucky, some decent [music](https://soundcloud.com/cube_code/pixel-dungon). I found all of that in Pixel Dungeon. It&#8217;s definitely a gem of open-source mobile games; I&#8217;d recommend trying it. I haven&#8217;t played it much yet, but it&#8217;s definitely worth sharing.

Side note: it turns out [Michael Toy was one of the original authors of Rogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Rush), in addition to also a main part of [the Netscape documentary called Code Rush](http://www.benjaminoakes.com/2015/02/15/code-rush-a-documentary-about-netscape-circa-2000/) that I watched recently. That&#8217;s quite a coincidence!
