[Dropbox Dropping Tiger and Leopard Support in May | Low End Mac](http://lowendmac.com/2015/dropbox-dropping-tiger-and-leopard-support-in-may/).

It&#8217;s far from surprising that Dropbox is dropping support for these old versions of OSX. However, it does remind me of how surprised I was when Dropbox stopped making new versions for iOS 6 soon after iOS 7 was released, while still shipping new releases for OSX 10.4 on PowerPC. Who would expect better software support for an old iMac than a much newer iPhone?

I only occasionally use PowerPC Macs at this point -- I mostly just have one to play with since it was offered to me for free, to be honest -- but it does make me a bit sad to know that some very powerful PowerMac G5s are just that much less useful when May rolls around. I don&#8217;t expect hardware to be supported forever, but a G5 Mac has to be about the worst deal ever in terms of official support. (My mom still has no idea what a bullet she dodged after Apple replaced her failing iMac G5 with an Intel one for free. A $1000+ investment in a computer is expensive, but it&#8217;s nothing short of amazing that she hasn&#8217;t had to buy something new since 2005, given what the computer industry tends to expect as an upgrade cycle. Or you could consider AppleCare to have been a great choice in her case.)

In the end, I hope this drop of support doesn&#8217;t send too many old computers to the landfill. Always remember to recycle your electronics responsibly when upgrading, through resale or a recycling program at Best Buy, an Apple store, etc.
