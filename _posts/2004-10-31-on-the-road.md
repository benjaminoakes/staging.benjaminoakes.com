Having just finished [On the Road](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0140042598/qid=1099277446/sr=8-2/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i2_xgl14/002-4037980-1012000?v=glance&s=books&n=507846), I&#8217;m now in search of a new book for College English. His book was a solid step away from what I usually think of as literature, but it was strangely refreshing. I think I want something different for my next book though. Earlier, I read[Foundation](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0553293354/qid=1099277574/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/002-4037980-1012000?v=glance&s=books&n=507846) and enjoyed it also. I was thinking maybe Herman Hesse&#8217;s[Siddhartha](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0553208845/qid=1099277663/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/002-4037980-1012000?v=glance&s=books&n=507846). [Buddhism](http://www.buddhanet.net/) was my inspiration to go with Kerouac for the last novel; maybe it will lead me further.

Any ideas out there?
