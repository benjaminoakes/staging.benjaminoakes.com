[Big Cable, Obama spar over government-run broadband networks - Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/01/obama-and-big-cable-spar-over-government-run-broadband-networks/).

We should have this available in Iowa City. It doesn&#8217;t need to be owned by the government; a cooperative or private organization would be fine too.

> Obama spoke at Cedar Falls Utilities in Iowa, one day after calling for an end to laws in 19 states that make it difficult for cities and towns to create their own broadband networks. Cedar Falls, which is not in one of those states, offers 1Gbps fiber Internet service for $135 a month. Comcastâ€™s fastest residential service tops out at 505Mbps and costs $400 a month.
