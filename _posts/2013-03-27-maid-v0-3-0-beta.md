title: Maid v0.3.0 Beta

excerpt: |
  I've released a beta of Maid v0.3.0.  It contains a bugfix which required an additional DSL method to be added.  The <code>move</code> method now only moves to pre-existing directories, and the new <code>rename</code> method should be used if renaming is the intention.  This makes it easier to detect accidental overwrites.

I&#8217;ve released a beta of Maid v0.3.0. It contains a bugfix which required an additional DSL method to be added. The `move` method now only moves to pre-existing directories, and the new `rename` method should be used if renaming is the intention. This makes it easier to detect accidental overwrites.

From my observations, most of the time [users who share their rules](https://github.com/benjaminoakes/maid/wiki) are using `move` with directories, so it should be a pretty painless upgrade... but since there&#8217;s a new method in the DSL, this new version is called v0.3.0 instead of v0.2.3. (A new version v0.4.0 is in the works -- it was once referred to as v0.3.0 -- so don&#8217;t let that confuse you. :) )

To install:

    gem install maid --pre
    

I&#8217;m interested in whether anyone runs into issues with the change I described. Otherwise, it should be pretty much the same as v0.2.2. Please leave a comment in [this issue](https://github.com/benjaminoakes/maid/issues/101) with your experiences!
