RubyConf 2011 was a blast. It was great to meet other Rubyists, get a ton of T-shirts (no really, I got 8 or so), and talk Aaron Patterson into giving Jonathan Magen a [special message](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8PPKWpLmkw).

If you weren&#8217;t able to go, I pushed my notes up to a [public GitHub wiki](https://github.com/benjaminoakes/rubyconf2011/wiki). A couple others from [Hedgeye](http://www.hedgeye.com) are adding their notes as well, so with those (plus the [Confreaks videos](http://confreaks.net/events/rubyconf2011) when those guys finally have access to a reliable Internet connection), it&#8217;s almost like you were there.
