[Tesla Model S Owners Unite To Offer Law-Skirting Test Drives In Iowa](http://insideevs.com/tesla-model-s-owners-unite-offer-law-skirting-test-drives-iowa/).

This plus the new <a href="http://www.eviowa.info" target="_blank">EVIowa</a> group means there&#8217;s growing interest in driving electric in Iowa.

> InsideEVs is on the scene for a law-skirting event where Model S owners (mostly from Minnesota) trekked to Iowa to hold a private test-drive event where potential Tesla-owning Iowans can drive the Model S to get a feel for the electric car.
> 
> There’s always a way to work around existing laws, right?
> 
> Paul Steier, director of the Iowa DOT’s Bureau of Investigation and Identity Protection, says that this test-drive event is perfectly legal since the Model S owners don’t work for Tesla and have no direct association with the automaker.
