From [my question on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2326609/how-to-organize-matlab-code) ([CC BY-SA 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)):

> How do you organize your Matlab code? I&#8217;ve come into ownership of several thousand lines of Matlab code, some as >900 line functions and a few directories full of `function_name.m` files. It&#8217;s hard to figure out what everything is doing (or relating to) or figure out the dependencies. I&#8217;d like to reorganize things as I figure out what does what, but Matlab limits what&#8217;s possible. What would you suggest?
