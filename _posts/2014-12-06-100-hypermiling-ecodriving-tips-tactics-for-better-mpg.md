[100+ Hypermiling / ecodriving tips & tactics for better mpg -- EcoModder.com](http://ecomodder.com/forum/EM-hypermiling-driving-tips-ecodriving.php).

A great list of hypermiling tips. It&#8217;s amazing that some **very dedicated** hypermilers could get 70 mpg in an early 2000s Honda Accord, or 150 mpg in a Toyota Prius. I&#8217;m nowhere close to that, but even taking a couple of reasonable ideas from this list could help anyone&#8217;s fuel economy.
