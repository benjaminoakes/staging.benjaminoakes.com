[Seven Things I Learned After Moving Across the Country](http://lifehacker.com/seven-things-i-learned-after-moving-across-the-country-1221354282).

[Sell Everything &#8211; What I learned selling (almost) all of my belongings to start over and why you should too](https://medium.com/what-i-learned-today/a27e01e84fac).

Our long distance move last year followed these posts pretty closely, although this was my first time reading them.  We had moved using a rented truck previously, and knew we didn&#8217;t want to spend that much again just to move non-essentials.

Although I can&#8217;t say it will be easy, I can recommend paring your belongings down before moving 1000 miles.  It&#8217;s funny how quickly new things can accumulate in the year after the move, though&#8230;  :)

**Edit:** To clarify, no we aren&#8217;t moving a long distance again. This was just some reflection on our move for others.  Sorry for any confusion!
