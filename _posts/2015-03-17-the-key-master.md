[Now I Know – The Key Master](http://nowiknow.com/the-key-master/).

> In December 2011, Harris got an email from someone claiming to be a recruiter for Google, wondering if the mathematician was interested in working for the company. The email noted that Harris “obviously [has] a passion for Linux and programming” and the recruiter wondered if Harris was “open to confidentially exploring opportunities with Google.” The email struck Harris as odd — his passion was clearly for math, not necessarily Linux or programming. And as far as he could remember, he hadn’t done anything which suggested an interest in working for Google. Harris&#8217;s skepticism took hold and he checked to see if the email was coming from Google at all — and upon further investigation, he found out that it was.

This guy should get an award, like Google normally gives when someone finds a flaw in their security and points it out to them instead of exploiting it.
