[Why is printf better than echo? &#8211; Unix & Linux Stack Exchange](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/65803/why-is-printf-better-than-echo)

I don&#8217;t always like the &#8220;epic&#8221; answers on StackExchange, but this one was really good. I hadn&#8217;t even realized how bad `echo` was for unfiltered input. Next time I shell script, I&#8217;ll keep `printf` in mind.
