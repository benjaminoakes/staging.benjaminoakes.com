i rediscovered a old favorite of mine a few days ago: metroid. its been a very long time since i&#8217;ve played it for the nes or snes, and im enjoying every minute of it!  it brings back a lot of memories:) i also found a rom hacking utiliy for metroid (haven&#8217;t found one for super nintendo, any links?) that you can use to rearange parts of the game, basically making a entire new game. i&#8217;ve found an example of this, metroid x, but haven&#8217;t tried to get it to work yet. also, metroid comics were a feature in <cite><a href="http://www.nintendo.com/">nintendo power</a></cite> a few years back. i found scans of them, and other nintendo related comics. what a wonderful thing the internet is!  :)
