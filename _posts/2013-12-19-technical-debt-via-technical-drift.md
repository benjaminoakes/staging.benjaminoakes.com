[Are you experiencing technical drift? -- Code Climate Blog](http://blog.codeclimate.com/blog/2013/12/19/are-you-experiencing-technical-drift/).

In summary: technical drift leads to technical debt, which can be prevented through iterative design.

This will definitely factor into the future plans for our codebase. Sometimes it&#8217;s easy to forget that you&#8217;re contemplating &#8220;Big Design&#8221; when you should really focus on iterative design.

From their post:

> If you’re not taking an active role in refactoring your application every week chances are you’re experiencing “technical drift”. Having a problem space that is continually changing necessitates continuous reworking of how your application is designed — what Agile practitioners call “iterative design”. When you’re able to do this effectively, you can round off the peaks and avoid some of the pitfalls of Big Design.
