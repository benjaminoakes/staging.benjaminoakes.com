I recently decided I should send my aging TI-83 graphing calculator out to pasture. I haven&#8217;t really used the thing since my freshman year of college, and if I am going to do any serious amount of math, I have much better looking (and _faster_) solutions on my iPhone and even my ancient [Zire 31](http://www.freewarepalm.com/calculator/easycalc.shtml). I&#8217;m a little surprised Texas Instruments hasn&#8217;t brought out anything significantly better -- a TI-83 feels out of place in 2010. I guess that&#8217;s what you get for stifling competition; they&#8217;ve basically owned the graphing calculator market for quite some time. (Seems a little like Windows XP to me.)

([Relevant XKCD](http://xkcd.com/768/))

Before [selling it on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/shops/alternate-imagination-media), I thought it would be best to save some of the TI-83 Basic programs I had written back at the turn of the millenium. Some of my first programming experience came from writing dinky programs on the thing (which wasn&#8217;t ever that easy -- keep in mind that it has a severely limiting 16 x 7 display). After figuring out what I was doing (a little) I even wrote a [hangman program](http://github.com/benjaminoakes/snippets/blob/master/ti83/hangman.ti83) (pictured above). It&#8217;s littered with ugly things like single letter variables and goto statements. I don&#8217;t even know if it&#8217;s possible to make functions... I think they have to be other programs, a la Matlab -- which is part of the reason that I say &#8220;Matlab is a great graphing calculator&#8221;.

At any rate, I typed up what I thought would be worth saving for &#8220;historical purposes&#8221; and even uploaded it to my [snippets repository on GitHub](http://github.com/benjaminoakes/snippets/tree/master/ti83/). Take it as my gift to the TI-83 hacker community. :P

**Update:** ...and within less than an hour, it sold on Amazon. The Internet still blows my mind sometimes.
