> On Sunday morning 27-year-old actor Anton Yelchin, who plays Chekov in the new Star Trek movies, was killed in a freak accident with his own car in the driveway of his home in Studio City. &#8220;It appears he momentarily exited his car and it rolled backward, causing trauma that led to his death,&#8221; a police spokesperson told the Hollywood Reporter.

So sad.
