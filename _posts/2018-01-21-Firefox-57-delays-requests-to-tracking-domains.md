> This has a positive effect on page load performance as we save some of the network bandwidth, I/O and CPU for loading and processing of images and scripts running on the site so the web page is complete and ready sooner.

> Tracking scripts are not disabled, we only delay their load for few seconds when we can.  Requests are kept on hold only while there are site sub-resources still loading and only up to about 6 seconds.  The delay is engaged only for scripts added dynamically or as async.  Tracking images and XHRs are always delayed, as well as any request made by a tracking script.  This is legal according all HTML specifications and itâ€™s assumed that well built sites will not be affected regarding functionality.
