[NTP&#8217;s Fate Hinges On &#8216;Father Time&#8217; -- InformationWeek](http://www.informationweek.com/it-life/ntps-fate-hinges-on-father-time/d/d-id/1319432?page_number=1).

> Or will this protocol go into a decline marked by drastically slowed development, fewer bug fixes, and greater security risks for the computers that use it? The question hinges to a surprising degree on the personal finances of a 59-year-old technologist in Talent, Ore., named Harlan Stenn.
