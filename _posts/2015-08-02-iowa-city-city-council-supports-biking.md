> On Monday, the Iowa City City Council voted to help fund a bike-sharing grant with the University of Iowa, authorized the creation of dedicated bike lanes to parts of First Avenue and Mormon Trek Boulevard, as well as changes to the cityâ€™s biking ordinance.

I hope there are more bike paths in the works as well.
