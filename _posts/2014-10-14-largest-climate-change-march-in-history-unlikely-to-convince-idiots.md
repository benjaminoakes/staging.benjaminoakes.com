[Largest Climate-Change March in History Unlikely to Convince Idiots -- The New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/largest-climate-change-march-history-unlikely-convince-idiots?mbid=rss).

Andy Borowitz cuts right to the core. I wish this were less true.

> 
> Despite bringing attention to a position that is embraced by more than ninety per cent of the world’s scientists, the People’s Climate March, which took place on Sunday in New York City, left a broad majority of the nation’s idiots unconvinced.
