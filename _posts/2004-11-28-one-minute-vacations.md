I found this [website](http://www.quietamerican.org/vacation.html) that has ambient noise from many different situations. I&#8217;ve been setting things like [rain and thunder](http://www.quietamerican.org/download/other/rain_and_thunder.mp3) on a continuous loop and listening to it when I&#8217;ve gotten tired of hearing music. Bonus points &#8217;cause it&#8217;s free.
