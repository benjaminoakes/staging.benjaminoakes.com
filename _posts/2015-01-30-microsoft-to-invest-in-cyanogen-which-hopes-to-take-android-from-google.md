[Microsoft to invest in Cyanogen, which hopes to take Android from Google - Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/01/microsoft-to-invest-in-cyanogen-hopes-to-take-android-away-from-google/).

> A Microsoft investment in the company would be the latest in Redmond&#8217;s ironic ties to Android. Microsoft is thought to make more from Android patent licensing fees than it does from Windows Phone, and through its purchase of Nokia, the company even briefly sold Android-based handsets. Now, according to the Journal, Microsoft will become an investor in a company that sells an Android distribution.

This is good news for AOSP, and hopefully Android as a whole. Having more Android investment from companies other than Google is a good thing.
