[Iowa City ranks among top users of public transit in the nation &#8211; TheGazette](http://thegazette.com/subject/news/iowa-city-ranks-among-top-users-of-public-transit-in-the-nation-20140801).

Way to go, Iowa City! Almost in the top ten for the United States. Number 11 isn&#8217;t bad, but we&#8217;re so close to beating Philadelphia that we should make that a goal. :)

From my experiences riding the bus regularly, there&#8217;s definitely a wide variety of people that use public transit, from working professionals who could probably drive everyday if they wanted, to those who only have the bus as a means of transportation. I personally take the bus to prevent extra carbon emissions and save some money, but when I can, I bike to get a little extra exercise. I also just like supporting public transit so it remains available to everyone. From what I&#8217;ve observed, busing and biking are common in Iowa City, partially because of the pedestrian culture here. I&#8217;d be curious how the transit usage numbers would differ between college students and otherwise, but I would guess the difference is not as large as many people would think. That said, other university-centric cities are near the top of the list, so it definitely has an effect.

It&#8217;s especially interesting to contrast with [the numbers for other places I&#8217;ve lived](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/how-your-citys-public-transit-stacks-up/) where public transit isn&#8217;t used by as many types of people. The numbers seem to match reality pretty well, especially for very car-dependent areas. Where does your city fall in the list?
