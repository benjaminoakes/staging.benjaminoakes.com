WindyCityRails was a lot of fun.

As I&#8217;ve done in the past, I took notes and put them into an [open wiki on GitHub](https://github.com/newhavenrb/conferences/wiki/WindyCityRails-2012). Some quick stats: the wiki project is up from approx. 220 stars to 241 right now, and even got a few more contributors (~49 &rarr; 53).

Anyway, I thought I&#8217;d share some of the better talks:

* David Chelimsky: [The RSpec Toolbox](https://github.com/newhavenrb/conferences/wiki/The-RSpec-Toolbox)
* Evan Light: [Frustration Driven Development](https://github.com/newhavenrb/conferences/wiki/Frustration-Driven-Development)
* Steve Klabnik: [Development and Philosophy](https://github.com/newhavenrb/conferences/wiki/Development-and-Philosophy)
* [Several really good Lightning Talks](https://github.com/newhavenrb/conferences/wiki/WindyCityRails-2012-Lightning-Talks)

Both David Chelimsky and Steve Klabnik contributed to the wiki, which was a nice surprise. :) Steve&#8217;s talk was really good, but hard to do it justice with any notes... I was happy to see that he annotated it.
