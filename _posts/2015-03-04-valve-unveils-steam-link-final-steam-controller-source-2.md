[Valve unveils Steam Link, final Steam controller, Source 2](http://www.osnews.com/story/28367/Valve_unveils_Steam_Link_final_Steam_controller_Source_2).

I&#8217;m happy to see SteamOS is still moving forward. I still think it would be a smart move for Valve to release Half Life 3 as a Linux exclusive. People would definitely buy a Steam Machine just for that, solving the &#8220;why would anyone use SteamOS?&#8221; problem. If they aren&#8217;t considering taking that route, SteamOS doesn&#8217;t make nearly as much sense.
