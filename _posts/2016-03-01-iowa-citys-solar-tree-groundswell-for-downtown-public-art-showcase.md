> Incorporating the original purpose of the Black Hawk Mini Park to serve as &#8220;guardians of the land,&#8221; and as a hands-on follow-up to Iowa City&#8217;s recent commitment to the Compact of Mayor&#8217;s climate agreement, the 100 Grannies&#8217; proposal is based on the globally acclaimed &#8220;Energy Tree&#8221; in Bristol, England&#8217;s central Millennium Square, which combines &#8220;community collaboration, artistic excellence, and science in a public art installation and renewable power source designed to engage the public in energy issues and address social inequality.&#8221;
