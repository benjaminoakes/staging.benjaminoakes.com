I&#8217;ve been listening to some [podcasts](http://www.podcast.net/) lately, mainly [Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/). However, since I listen to these on my Palm, I&#8217;ve been having to sync these manually. It&#8217;s a pain.

The [iPodder](http://www.ipodder.org/) software comes in a variety of flavors, including a [PocketPC](http://www.ipodder.org/directory/4/ipodderSoftware/pocketpc) version. Now, why are we, as Palm OS users, getting handed the shaft? I haven&#8217;t experimented much, but when I get this much fabled laptop of mine, it&#8217;ll have a card reader and I could sync to the &#8220;Audio&#8221; folder on it, but that&#8217;s really just a workaround. I guess it&#8217;s a pretty similar situation for the PocketPC users, which leads me to wonder why they don&#8217;t have a Palm-friendly solution.
