This is my review from [iRobot Advanced Power System Ni-MH Battery, 3000 mAh, 17373 (Kitchen)](http://www.amazon.com/iRobot-Advanced-System-Battery-17373/dp/B0015SBAGE/ref=cm_cr_dp_orig_subj)

Works as expected. Our old Roomba battery was lasting only a few minutes at a time, so we purchased this. Now he runs for a good 2+ hours. It fixed our problem well, but I do wish the batteries would last longer or be cheaper.

**Update (2013-04-01):** While I still think Roombas are undeniably cool, they&#8217;re far overpriced for the amount of repairs and replacement parts users have to purchase, in my opinion. The batteries are especially bad, looking back on it.
