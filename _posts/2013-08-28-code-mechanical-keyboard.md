[CODE Mechanical Keyboard](http://codekeyboards.com/) via [Coding Horror](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2013/08/the-code-keyboard.html).

Looks pretty awesome, but I&#8217;d have a really hard time justifying spending $150 on a keyboard to myself. Highlights: backlit, good media keys, detachable micro USB cord (might work well with an Android tablet with USB OTG), and no Windows logo. :-)
