[iFixit’s 2014 Mac Mini teardown shows a sealed, less-upgradeable redesign | Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/10/ifixits-2014-mac-mini-teardown-shows-a-sealed-less-upgradeable-redesign/).

It&#8217;s funny, I was just thinking about how it was nice that Apple was still offering a lower-priced computer with components designed to be upgraded, in contrast with their other offerings. 

While considering a replacement for an older Mac mini, the non-upgradable RAM and storage in the 2014 model are a letdown. Also the small performance improvement to the 2012 model (and actually a performance **decrease** if comparing the high-end models) is also less than I was expecting. The only real benefit is the low-end model runs $100 cheaper than in 2012 -- though it isn&#8217;t a better deal.

In the end, I expect the 2012 model to retain its value for some time.
