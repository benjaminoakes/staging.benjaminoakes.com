The host of _The Price is Right_ never ceases to amaze me.

I learned from a biography that he is a vegetarian. I didn&#8217;t really expect it, but I had never really thought about it much. For example, he always ends his show by saying &#8220;help control the pet population: have your pets spayed or neutered.&#8221; But the first time that I heard that he was vegetarian I had to stop and reflect on that point. Not something I expect from a game show host, for some reason. I was flabbergasted, really...

It&#8217;s a small coincidence that Bob Barker and I are both vegetarians, but that pales in comparison to the fact that we were both [born](http://www.sptimes.com/2003/12/09/Floridian/At_80__Bob_Barker_is_.shtml) on the same day. It makes one wonder, doesn&#8217;t it?

I can&#8217;t help but wonder what other similarities there might be.
