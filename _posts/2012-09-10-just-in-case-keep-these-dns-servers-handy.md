Having problems accessing a website? [GoDaddy](http://godaddy.com) is [having DNS problems](http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/10/godaddy-outage-takes-down-millions-of-sites/), which may be the cause.

Using [OpenDNS](http://opendns.com) nameservers is a temporary workaround. It&#8217;s always good to have these around, so save them someplace handy **now** (in something that doesn&#8217;t require internet access):

<pre>208.67.222.222
208.67.220.220
</pre>

Use those in the network settings in your OS, or even in your router.

Personally, I keep these in my [public wiki on GitHub](https://github.com/benjaminoakes/public_notes/wiki/DNS), which is synced to my computer using [SparkleShare](http://sparkleshare.org).
