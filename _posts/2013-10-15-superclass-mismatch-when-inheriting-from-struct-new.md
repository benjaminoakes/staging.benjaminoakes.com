We recently ran into an error that took a little thought:

<pre><code class="no-highlight">TypeError: superclass mismatch for class FooJob
</code></pre>

Specifically, `FooJob` was a DelayedJob custom job class. Unfortunately, [DelayedJob had recommended a structure like this](https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job#custom-jobs):

<pre><code class="ruby">class FooJob &lt; Struct.new(:bar, :baz)
  def perform
    # ...
  end
end
</code></pre>

When this class was required more than once, it gave us our `TypeError`. (I think it was loaded from two different paths.) Although the two structs made by `Struct.new` were created with the same arguments, they're actually different objects, hence the superclass mismatch.

Moral of the story: you should [never inherit from `Struct`](https://u.osu.edu/gee.24/2012/12/13/dont-inherit-from-struct/)! Do this instead:

<pre><code class="ruby">FooJob = Struct.new(:bar, :baz) do
  def perform
    # ...
  end
end
</code></pre>

After that change, our `TypeError` went away. Good to know!

**Update:** I [submitted a pull request](https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job/pull/590) to hopefully prevent other people from falling into this same trap.
