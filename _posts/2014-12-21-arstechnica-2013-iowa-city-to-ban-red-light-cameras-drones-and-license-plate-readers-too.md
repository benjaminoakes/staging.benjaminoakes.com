[Iowa City to ban red-light cameras, drones, and license plate readers too - Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/06/iowa-city-to-ban-not-only-red-light-cameras-but-drones-license-plate-readers-too/).

This is old news, but I was especially happy to see a story about Iowa City in Ars Technica. I found it via [today&#8217;s article about red light cameras in Chicago](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/12/major-chicago-study-finds-red-light-cameras-not-safer-cause-more-rear-end-injuries/).

I especially like some of the comments:

> Wow. Very nice to see some grass roots activity for privacy. Especially for non-necessary tools.
> 
> Good on Iowa City&#8217;s residents. (And a pretty nifty way to transition a petition to law.) 

> How&#8217;s the IT job market in Iowa City? I may just move... 

> Reasons like this are why I love Iowa City and would like to relocate there in the future.
