> During the interview he [Dan Ingalls] was asked about the origin of those enumeration methods of the Smalltalk collection classes. Alan Kay had told the interviewer that they had come from a song. At first Dan didn’t remember this but then remembered that there was a song which had a string of words like inject, select, detect etc. As far as I recall, though he didn’t name the song.
