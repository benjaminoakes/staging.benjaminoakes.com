Over Thanksgiving, I was surprised to run into the &#8220;crystal Tux&#8221; logo on a bag of ice melt. It&#8217;s the same [public domain image](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tux-G2.svg) more commonly used for Linux... but since it&#8217;s public domain (not just &#8220;open source&#8221;), this is a perfectly legitimate use. It&#8217;s funny where things like this show up!
