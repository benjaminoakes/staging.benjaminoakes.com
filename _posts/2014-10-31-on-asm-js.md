[On Asm.js â€” Acko.net](http://acko.net/blog/on-asmjs/).

A great perspective on the role of JavaScript in the future of the web. I don&#8217;t agree with all of it, but it&#8217;s certainly true that asm.js still feels like a clever hack, perhaps taken too far.

The ASCII/UTF-8 comparison to JavaScript/asm.js is something I hadn&#8217;t considered. That&#8217;s even more telling when you realize that ASCII has its roots in telegrams... Where will JavaScript be 100 years from now?
