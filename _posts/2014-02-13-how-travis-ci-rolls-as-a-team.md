[The Travis CI Blog: How We Roll As A Team: Our Company&#8217;s Work Values](http://blog.travis-ci.com/2014-02-13-how-we-roll-as-a-team/).

Key points they brought up:

  * &#8220;Shared vision rather than product managers (Everyone owns the product)&#8221;
  * &#8220;Everyone does customer support&#8221;
  * &#8220;Ongoing communication instead of daily standups&#8221; (however in my experience, daily standups are for more than what they argue in their post)
  * &#8220;Personal life comes first&#8221;
