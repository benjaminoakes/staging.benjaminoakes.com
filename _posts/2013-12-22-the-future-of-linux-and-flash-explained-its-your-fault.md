[The future of Linux and Flash explained -- It&#8217;s your fault](http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/flash-linux-future.html).

A good insight on the future of desktop Linux from 2011-2012. A bit ironic, given the turn of events with Steam, but a pretty realistic assessment.

Now that there&#8217;s widespread support for h.264 and WebM, my personal need for Flash is rapidly disappearing. That&#8217;s a good outcome, all things considered.
