Alright, you may be wondering why I&#8217;m making a blog post about a VCR in 2011. Blu-Ray is supposed to kill DVD any year now, right?

A VCR is actually a more relevant device in 2011 than I would have originally thought, mostly because of one reason: lots of people don&#8217;t want VHS tapes anymore. It&#8217;s really easy to find all sorts of free and cheap copies of movies you would want but wouldn&#8217;t buy otherwise. [Goodwill](http://www.goodwill.org/) and [Salvation Army](http://www.salvationarmyusa.org/) are good examples; we&#8217;ve spent a few dollars and ended up with a dozen movies, including [older Star Trek movies I&#8217;d never seen](http://www.amazon.com/Star-Trek-VI-Undiscovered-Country/dp/630242335X/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1294512878&sr=8-5) (picked up for $0.25 a piece), along with lots of good 80s, 90s, and early 2000s movies. [Freecycle](http://www.freecycle.org/) and &#8220;urban recycling&#8221; (or &#8220;curb shopping&#8221;) often turn up with good offers too, but for free. They all play with better quality than I seem to remember, too.

When it comes down to it, price really is king. Sure, they may not play that great on a HDTV, but since we&#8217;re not planning to upgrade soon (or re-buy all our movies on Blu-Ray as Hollywood seems to be hoping), it&#8217;s a great option for getting a lot of good movies for next to nothing -- especially since we don&#8217;t have cable.

That said, we recently had a problem with our VCR (also free, of course): The tracking looked to be completely off, leaving us with nothing but static. We had thought Delta ruined some tapes in our recent holiday trip ([they ruined enough of our other things](http://twitter.com/benjaminoakes/status/22252748820979712)), since we&#8217;ve previously used the VCR just fine.

    Thx @<a href="https://twitter.com/delta">delta</a> for sending the bag to our door. Not happy with a call before 6am or the damage to the bag though. Going to avoid u in the future

My first instinct was to use the channel up/down buttons on our universal remote to try to adjust the tracking. That didn&#8217;t help at all. The menu wasn&#8217;t very helpful, either. It&#8217;s a [Sharp VC-A593](http://www.google.com/search?q=Sharp+VC-A593), which I couldn&#8217;t find more than [a few questions about](http://www.fixya.com/support/t4192685-adjust_tracking_sharp_vc_a593_vcr) and [dead links to manuals](http://www.usersmanualguide.com/sharp/video_recorder/vc-a560u_h960u_h961u) online. After testing cable connections and with tapes we&#8217;ve previously viewed, it definitely was a tracking problem. But I did find a solution.

**Solution:** Use the channel up/down butons on the VCR itself. You may have to rapidly push up/down 50+ times to see any difference at all, but eventually it came back to life.

At some point, the tracking fell out of alignment and we hadn&#8217;t noticed. We were about to throw it out, until I played around with it some more.
