[Star Trek movie supercuts: just the spaceships &#8211; Boing Boing](http://boingboing.net/2015/03/09/star-trek-movie-supercuts-jus.html?utm_source=feedburner).

Star Trek movies recut to only have the ships. I&#8217;d agree that they&#8217;re soothing. But I wonder where the 2009 and later films are&#8230;

Watch &#8217;em now; this seems like something that Paramount would issue a DMCA takedown notice for.
