[Ask HN: What happens to older developers? - Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7372997).

(via [Mark Scully](http://www.datapraxis.com/))

Interesting topic, but way too many of the comments focus on salaries. However, I think that&#8217;s mostly because of a comment about $300K/yr being a bad salary cap that set off a bunch of replies (and for good reason). Let&#8217;s just say I&#8217;m very happy to be in Iowa City.

Anyway, just a reminder to myself to focus on deeper knowledge rather than a breadth of knowledge, etc.
