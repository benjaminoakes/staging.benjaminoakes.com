Since I wasn&#8217;t able to make it to the [newhaven.rb meetup](http://www.meetup.com/newhavenrb/events/86235652/), I ended up presenting about [Maid](https://github.com/benjaminoakes/maid) at [ICRuby](http://icruby.org) today. I was happy there was quite a bit of interest.

I thought I&#8217;d share [my (quick and dirty) slides](/media/2012/10/25/maid-presentation.html) and [example scripts](https://github.com/benjaminoakes/maid-example) I created for the presentation. There&#8217;s no audio (besides [the Ruby5 story](http://ruby5.envylabs.com/episodes/306-episode-302-august-31st-2012)), but you should be able to get a good sense of what I presented.

There were lots of good questions (which I wish I had written down), including how to use it with iTunes, how to use it as a replacement for `logrotate`, how I was using [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) for testing, how to automate more than set of rules, etc.
