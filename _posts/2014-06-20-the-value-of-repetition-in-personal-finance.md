[The Value of RepetitionSee Debt Run](http://www.seedebtrun.com/value-repetition/).

> I feel the need for repetition in the lessons of personal finance in the same way I feel the need to hear my partner say, “I love you”. While I already know it to be true, I need to hear it regularly. Similarly, I need to hear those familiar money lessons often. Even though I know them, it takes that reminder, that moment of checking in, to make sure I’m actually implementing them.
