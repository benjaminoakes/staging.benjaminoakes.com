I used to be into an operating system called [BeOS](http://www.bebits.com/app/2680). There was a band made up of employees of Be Inc. called [The Cotton Squares](http://www.cottonsquares.com) ([archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20010202025600/http://www.cottonsquares.com/)) who had their songs posted in MP3 format on their website, but I can only seem to get two of them: 5038 and Virtual Void. Oddly, only a few people on [BeShare](http://www.bebits.com/app/1330) seem to have any. 

The horrible thing is, I think I deleted them a few years ago. That&#8217;s the thing about computers, you can be a pack rat with out cluttering up your house. I guess I went on a spring cleaning rampage. 

**Update (2010/06/06):** I&#8217;ve found copies of the MP3s I mentioned since writing the original post. I think it&#8217;s pretty safe to say they&#8217;re some of the last copies available. Since I know I&#8217;m [not the only person](http://www.haiku-os.org/) who would go looking for these, I thought I should post them here. The [BeOS](http://www.beincorporated.com/) has gone away, the [band&#8217;s site](http://www.cottonsquares.com/) is down, I can&#8217;t figure out how to contact their [label](http://www.catastropherecords.com/), their [fan club](http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Scene/7025/csmusic.html) is no more, and I can&#8217;t even find anything on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dpopular&field-keywords=cotton+squares&x=24&y=23).
  
I think I found Baron Arnold (a member of the band) [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/people/Baron-Arnold/521456754) and [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/catrec), so I&#8217;m trying to ask him first. 

**Update (2010/06/22):** My efforts to contact the band, its members, and their label has hit a standstill. All seem to have disappeared a number of years ago (but if that&#8217;s not the case, please let me know!) and I can&#8217;t find any commercial copies of these anywhere. I know several people have come by my site looking for more info about the Cotton Squares, so I thought I&#8217;d post the MP3s. Here they are:

  * [5038](http://media.benjaminoakes.com/2004/The Cotton Squares/5038.mp3)
  * [Focus Pocus](http://media.benjaminoakes.com/2004/The Cotton Squares/Focus Pocus.mp3)
  * [Search and Replace](http://media.benjaminoakes.com/2004/The Cotton Squares/Search and Replace.mp3)
  * [The Magnetik Zones of Love](http://media.benjaminoakes.com/2004/The Cotton Squares/The Magnetik Zones of Love.mp3)
  * [Virtual (Void) (Remix)](http://media.benjaminoakes.com/2004/The Cotton Squares/Virtual (Void) (Remix).mp3)
  * [Virtual Void](http://media.benjaminoakes.com/2004/The Cotton Squares/Virtual Void.mp3)

(I especially like Focus Pocus.) 

This is strictly a posting as a fan. If you&#8217;re the copyright holder and would like them removed, please [contact me](/contact/).

**Update (2010/07/14):** Baron has blessed sharing the MP3s here. See the comments below.

**Update (2010/09/19):** [Joe Prostko](http://joeprostko.com/) contacted me with [a download](http://joeprostko.com/beos/cotton_squares.zip) of the above songs, plus some remixes. Turns out I&#8217;m not the only one re-hosting this stuff. :) Thanks, Joe!
