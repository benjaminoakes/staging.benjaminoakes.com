excerpt: "I've seen some of the experimenting that people have done with bringing legal code (i.e., laws) to GitHub.  As an open source developer, I think Clay has it right when he says that transparency is only one side of openness and that citizen created bills are (hopefully) inevitable.  After all, our government is too important to leave exclusively to politicians."

I&#8217;ve seen some of the experimenting that people have done with bringing legal code (i.e., laws) to GitHub. As an open source developer, I think Clay has it right when he says that transparency is only one side of openness and that citizen created bills are (hopefully) inevitable. After all, our government is too important to leave exclusively to politicians.

Or, you know, the Internet will just be a place we go to see funny pictures of cats. It&#8217;s what we make of it.

**Update:** Just as an experiment, I made [a repository for the laws of Iowa](https://github.com/icruby/code-of-iowa) because I couldn&#8217;t find an existing one. I&#8217;m experimenting to see if any others are interesed as well, based on star count or contributions.
