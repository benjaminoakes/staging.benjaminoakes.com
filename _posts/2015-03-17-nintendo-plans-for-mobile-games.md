[What We Know About Nintendo’s Plans For Mobile Games - TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/17/nintendo-s-long-awaited-step-into-mobile/?ncid=rss#P4w28O:JPS6).

> The games giant partnered up with fellow Japanese outfit DeNA, a billion-dollar company that made its name with phone gaming, in a surprise alliance announced today that will see the duo develop mobile apps. But don’t expect a sea change from Nintendo; mobile is an expansion of its existing reach and not a wide-ranging pivot away from games consoles.

Interesting... I could see this working out well, even if all they do is release some Virtual Console titles (as many companies have done in the past). I&#8217;ve bought those from Capcom, Sega, Square-Enix, and others. Offering older titles could help Nintendo&#8217;s footing on mobile, but not erode sales of their own hardware. Other tie-in games could do the same, but Virtual Console is low-hanging fruit.
