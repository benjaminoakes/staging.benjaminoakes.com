[&#8220;Read Later&#8221; Apps Compared: Pocket vs. Instapaper vs. Readability](http://lifehacker.com/5894995/bookmark-and-read-later-apps-compared-read-it-later-vs-instapaper-vs-readability).

I used to use Instapaper often, but was turned off by the price for mobile apps and (former?) incompatibility with Android.  Their web app isn&#8217;t very mobile friendly either.  Over time, I started using Instapaper less and less... Pocket seemed like a nice alternative, but I couldn&#8217;t really bring myself to switch.

Looking for a self-hosted alternative to other &#8220;read later&#8221; apps?  I&#8217;ve been pretty happy with [Poche](https://github.com/inthepoche/poche) (PHP, [demo](http://demo.inthepoche.com/)) so far.  I even deleted my Instapaper account and switched to using Poche instead. It&#8217;s nice and lightweight, with a responsive design that works on phones, tablets, and desktops.

I haven&#8217;t gotten an offline version working (there&#8217;s an Android app though, and [an export to ePub feature seems likely](https://github.com/inthepoche/poche/issues/79)).  My only complaint so far? A lot of the user community only seems to discuss Poche in French (&#8220;poche&#8221; means &#8220;pocket&#8221; in French) -- certainly something I&#8217;m not accustomed to in a largely Anglophone open source community.

**Update:** Poche [linked back from their blog](http://blog.inthepoche.com/post/61843174182/looking-for-a-self-hosted-alternative-to-other). Thanks!
