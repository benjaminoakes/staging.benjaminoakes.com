[Security Maintenance Extension of Ruby 1.8.7 and 1.9.2](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/12/17/maintenance-of-1-8-7-and-1-9-2/).

[Heroku - A Patch in Time: Securing Ruby](https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2013/12/5/a_patch_in_time_securing_ruby).

Heroku has stepped up to support Ruby 1.8.7 and 1.9.2 for an additional 6 months. It&#8217;s good that they are still maintained, but it does reduce the incentives to upgrade. This &#8220;reverses&#8221; the sunset of 1.8.7, in some sense.

From the post:

> This maintenance extension is made possible by Heroku, see their blog post A Patch in Time: Securing Ruby for more information.
> 
> [...]
> 
> You may remember an announcement approximately 6 months ago that sunset 1.8.7.
> 
> While ruby-core will no longer resume maintenance of 1.8.7 or 1.9.2, Terence and Zachary will support these versions for security maintenance as part of a corporate sponsorship.
