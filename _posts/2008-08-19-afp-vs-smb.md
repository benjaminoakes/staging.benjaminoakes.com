I have an external hard drive set up on a Mac mini that I&#8217;d like to access over the network. I thought it would be easiest to use AFP, but I ran into permissions problems, receiving errors such as &#8220;You may need to enter the name and password for an administrator on this computer to change the item named &#8216;foo&#8217;.&#8221; even though everything in question should have been owned by me. This only occurreed when trying to copy files over to the shared volume. After doing some googling and fiddling, I gave up on AFP. SMB (which is configured under &#8220;Options&#8221; in Sharing Preferences) ended up working fine.
