> Nokia may be making the Android X, X+ and XL handsets, but at the end of the day it was Microsoft&#8217;s call to produce Android phones.

> If you think Nokia&#8217;s decision to introduce a line of Android-powered phones is a threat to Microsoft, think again. With Microsoft&#8217;s new &#8220;devices and services&#8221; emphasis, these phones are a logical fit, even after the acquisition closes.
