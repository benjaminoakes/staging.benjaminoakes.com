> It will be the first mass-priced electric car with a range of 200 miles or more, and it will go on sale a year before the much-vaunted Tesla Model 3. [...] Moreover, it&#8217;s the highest range of any electric car sold to date that doesn&#8217;t have a Tesla badge on it.

For comparison, the 2017 Chevy Volt has a rated 53-mile EV range (about a 440-mile EV plus gas range) and 106 MPGe combined.Â  The Bolt doesn&#8217;t quite make sense for driving across Iowa, but given some time for the charging infrastructure to develop and the range to increase a little more... Well, it will be interesting to see what the situation is in a few years. Until then, plug-in hybrids like the Volt make a lot of sense.
