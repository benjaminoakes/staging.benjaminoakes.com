From my posts onÂ <a href="http://www.meetup.com/icruby/events/215464092/" target="_blank">the Meetup event</a>:

> Hello Rubyists,
> 
> It&#8217;s almost the first Thursday of the month again. We&#8217;re always interested in having members present Ruby-related topics to the group, so if you&#8217;ve been playing with anything cool, please consider presenting! We&#8217;re pretty informal, so anything you present doesn&#8217;t have to be a &#8220;polished&#8221; keynote-style presentation; it can be as simple as plugging in your laptop and showing some code you&#8217;ve been working on.

> If anyone would like to present something, please leave a comment [on the Meetup event].

> Best wishes,
