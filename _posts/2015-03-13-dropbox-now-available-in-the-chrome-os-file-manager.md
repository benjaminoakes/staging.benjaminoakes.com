[How To Access Dropbox from the Chromebook File Manager -- OMG! Chrome!](http://www.omgchrome.com/you-can-now-access-dropbox-on-your-chromebook/).

> A new Chrome app allows users to access Dropbox files from the Chrome OS File Manager, just like Google Drive. You can browse and search files stored in your Dropbox and upload new ones.
> 
> The nifty new feature is possible thanks to the File System Provider API which has been available in Googleâ€™s cloud-centric OS for the past few releases.

A lack of Dropbox support has been a big roadblock for me when I consider purchasing a Chromebook. While this Chrome app doesn&#8217;t seem ideal, it seems like it could be at least as good as Dropbox on Android.
