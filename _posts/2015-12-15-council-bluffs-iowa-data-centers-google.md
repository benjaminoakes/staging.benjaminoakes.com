> In 2007, we announced plans to construct a data center in Council Bluffs. Then in the spring of 2012, we announced that we would be building a second facility. We&#8217;ve established a long-term commitment to the region and state and will have invested over $2.5 billion by 2019. We&#8217;ve created over 300 jobs on site so far, and we work hard to support the communities in which our employees live and work.

4 of the 7 availability zones in the US are in Iowa. Pretty nice!
