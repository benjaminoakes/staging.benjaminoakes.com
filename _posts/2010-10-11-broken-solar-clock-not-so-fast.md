![Mainstays WT-8029U Solar Powered Clock](/media/2010/10/11/Mainstays-WT-8029U.jpg)

Just a note to other Mainstays WT-8029U owners: if you think your clock is broken and the battery won&#8217;t hold a charge, you might be wrong. There are **two** solar modes you have to set. The first is on the back, under the battery compartment. The second is set using the menu:

  * Press &#8220;set&#8221; until &#8220;SOL&#8221; appears in the day field (12 times)
  * Set it to &#8220;off&#8221; (press &#8220;+&#8221;)

We thought this clock might have been broken until I found this tidbit in [the manual](http://www.lacrossetechnology.com/8029/manual.pdf). Before changing this setting, the screen would go blank when the solar panel wasn&#8217;t in direct light.

Otherwise, this is a great little clock. We got ours for $9 on clearance at Walmart (probably because of people thinking it was broken). It charges a AA battery with solar power, sets itself to atomic time, and even has temperature and humidity readings.

At any rate, I hope that helps somebody out. :)
