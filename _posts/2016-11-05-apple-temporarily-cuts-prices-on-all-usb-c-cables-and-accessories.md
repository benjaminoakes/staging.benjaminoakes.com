These adapters are still pretty expensive when you consider the base price of the laptop went up by $400 and you might need maybe $100 worth of dongles to match needed functionality on the previous generation of the MacBook Pro.  (The lack of HDMI is especially off-putting.)  USB-C is here to stay -- [no question about it](http://www.benjaminoakes.com/2015/01/09/usb-3-1-and-type-c-look-awesome/) -- but this situation is making a lot of people reconsider upgrading.  Personally, I would have preferred a thicker laptop that happened to add USB-C ports in this generation.

Thinking back, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever had an Apple computer without at least one adapter involved, but this is getting to be a bit extreme.  &#8220;There&#8217;s a dongle for that.&#8221;
