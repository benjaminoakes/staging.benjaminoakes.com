I did an interview with UGtastic at WindyCityRails. They just tweeted the video so I thought I&#8217;d embed it here. From [their description](http://ugtastic.com/interviews/midwestern-and-east-coast-ruby-community):

> #### [Midwestern and East Coast Ruby Community](http://ugtastic.com/interviews/midwestern-and-east-coast-ruby-community)
>
> <a href="http://benjaminoakes.com">Benjamin Oakes</a> helped start the <a href="http://twitter.com/icruby">Iowa City Ruby</a> user-group before moving out to Connecticut and helping start up the <a href="http://newhavenrb.org">New Haven Ruby</a>. We discuss a little bit of the differences between running a group in the Mid-west versus the East Coast.
