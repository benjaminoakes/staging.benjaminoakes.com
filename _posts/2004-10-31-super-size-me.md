I finally saw [Super Size Me](http://www.supersizeme.com/) last night. Very interesting. After we couldn&#8217;t find [Full Metal Jacket](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093058/) at the [Video Place](http://www.switchboard.com/bin/cgiad.dll?PR=118&BI=116096008&amp;MEM=1&L=video+place&T=Harlan&S=IA&QV=02A65D8A1112494103313203O01A5F40D97B48D4151CF3203O07A5F50D97B48D4152CF3203O03A42C3D9CB48D4151CF3203&QT=BNL), I saw it on the shelf. I like documentaries, as do a few of my friends, so it wasn&#8217;t a hard decision to make. If your stomach is easily upset, do yourself a favor and don&#8217;t watch the &#8220;Smoking Fry&#8221; bonus feature. Especially if you&#8217;ve eaten at [McDonald&#8217;s](http://www.mcdonalds.com/) lately.
