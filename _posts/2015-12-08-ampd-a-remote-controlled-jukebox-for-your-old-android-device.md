Fill a MicroSD card with music, install [ampd](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=be.deadba.ampd), and hook your old Android to your stereo. Violà, you have an awesome, remote-controlled, energy-efficient jukebox. This is the best use I&#8217;ve found for an old Android device, especially one with a mediocre display. 

Pair it with a client like the very high-quality [MPDroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.namelessdev.mpdroid) on your everyday phone, or [another client for your platform of choice](http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Clients).
