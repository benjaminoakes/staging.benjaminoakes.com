[Recycling is Bullshit; Make Nov. 15 Zero Waste Day, not America Recycles Day : TreeHugger](http://www.treehugger.com/sustainable-product-design/recycling-is-bullshit-make-nov-15-zero-waste-day-not-america-recycles-day.html).

I expected something a little different when I saw the title (which was missing the subtitle when I clicked). Good points about producers using recycling to keep from having to manage reusables.
