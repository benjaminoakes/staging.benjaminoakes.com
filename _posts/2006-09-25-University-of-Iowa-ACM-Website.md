<p>
I was part of a group of students that brought the <a href="http://acm.uiowa.edu/">University of Iowa ACM</a> (Association for Computing Machinery) back to life.  I did some graphic/web design for the group during my freshman year, but then got very busy with school soon thereafter.  (I was trying to combat the bad joke that computer scientists can't design, in a way.)
</p>

<p>
The group is still growing strong, but ended up <a href="http://acm.uiowa.edu/">altering my design</a> sometime after I became less involved.  I really didn't have the time to maintain it any longer, so I let them take ownership of it.
