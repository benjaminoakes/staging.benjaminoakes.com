It&#8217;s been too busy with [school](http://harlan.k12.ia.us/) to do much web surfing and, finally, I upgraded to the full 1.0 release of [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/). For the most part, it remained very similar to the Preview Release. One thing that I have noticed is that a little green icon appears next to &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">H</span>elp&#8221; in the menubar, particularly when the browser opens a new window. However, it stays visible only for a matter of seconds, so I haven&#8217;t yet discovered it&#8217;s purpose.

Check back, I may soon find the answer.
