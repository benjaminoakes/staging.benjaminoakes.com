Being a very busy student, it was a mistake to borrow [Metroid Prime](http://www.metroid.com/prime/). It came out a few years ago, I know, but, wow, is it ever a great game. The Metroid series was always my favorite growing up, and it&#8217;s a joy to be playing it again. At the beginning, the first person perspective felt awkward, but, now that I&#8217;ve accustomed myself, it feels strangely natural. Somebody stop me now, or else this thing that I own (borrowed, actually) will end up [owning me](http://www.chuckpalahniuk.net/fcbook.php).
