I'm not sure what this means in situations that used to require license fees.  Licensing MP3 has been an issue in open source products like Ubuntu and Firefox in the past, and a reason that many games and some streaming services use Ogg Vorbis instead.  (Spotify used to use Ogg Vorbis, not sure about now, however.)
