From their [press release](http://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2015/may/0527-carplay.html), the following Chevy models will have Android Auto and Apple CarPlay support:

  * Camaro
  * Colorado
  * Corvette
  * Cruze
  * Impala
  * Malibu
  * Silverado
  * Spark
  * Suburban
  * Tahoe
  * Volt

For those unfamiliar with Android Auto or Apple CarPlay, it lets you replace or supplement the infotainment system that comes with your car.  For example, you could use a music or navigation app running on your phone, rather than using the software that came with the car.  This will be especially interesting 10 years from now (2025!), when you might really wish you had a more up-to-date infotainment system in your 2016 model-year car.  These Android and Apple systems make it much easier to update how your car works, especially compared to physically removing part of your dashboard and replacing it.  Personally, I&#8217;ve been thinking it would be interesting just to leave an old smartphone in the car, charging over USB and loaded with music and maps that were downloaded over WiFi.

I&#8217;m especially intrigued by this because I&#8217;ve been considering a replacement for our 2003 model-year car, and it&#8217;s important to think 10 years ahead for such a big purchase.  (After all, we&#8217;re using a 2003 model-year car in 2015.)  While Android Auto or Apple CarPlay support isn&#8217;t likely to make or break our decision, it definitely has its benefits.
