[Like last week](http://www.benjaminoakes.com/2013/04/22/weekly-roundup-2/), these are some interesting posts I found around the web, along with some commentary from me.

  * **<a target="_blank" href="http://mnmlist.com/havent/">things I don&#8217;t have that many do</a>** &mdash; Lists like these always make me reconsider whether I really need certain things in my life. Of course, I have most of the items listed, but I had this in mind when I got my hair cut shorter recently, and when considering other purchases. I worry a little about Leo not having health insurance, though.
  * **<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/benjaminoakes/delayed-plugins-airbrake/issues/1">GitHub Notification: Happy to help with maintenance</a>** &mdash; I was very happily surprised to get a response from my &#8220;looking for maintainer&#8221; ad within a day.
  * **<a target="_blank" href="http://liliputing.com/2013/04/amd-acknowledges-plans-for-arm-based-embedded-chips.html?utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Liliputing+%28Liliputing%29">AMD acknowledges plans for ARM-based embedded chips</a>** &mdash; The processor space is getting interesting...
  * **<a target="_blank" href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/04/should-i-upgrade-to-ubuntu-13-04?utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+d0od+%28OMG%21+Ubuntu%21%29">Should I Upgrade to Ubuntu 13.04?</a>** &mdash; Yes, they could have added more features, but I&#8217;m happy they focused on fit and finish. It&#8217;s noticeably faster, even running on a USB stick, so I&#8217;m considering upgrading from 12.04 LTS.
  * **<a target="_blank" href="http://liliputing.com/2013/04/bn-nook-color-gets-official-cm10-1-nightlies-android-4-2.html?utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Liliputing+%28Liliputing%29">B&N NOOK Color gets official CM10.1 nightlies (Android 4.2)</a>** &mdash; I considered getting one of these tablets just to run Cyanogen Mod (back before I decided on [Nexus 7](http://www.benjaminoakes.com/2013/02/11/is-an-ipad-mini-or-a-nexus-7-better-for-a-geek/)). I&#8217;m happy that these can stay useful longer; who knows what garage sales they&#8217;ll show up at...
  * **<a target="_blank" href="http://liliputing.com/2013/04/sony-bring-stock-android-to-xperia-z-smartphone-with-aosp-project.html?utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Liliputing+%28Liliputing%29">Sony bring stock Android to Xperia Z smartphone with AOSP Project</a>** &mdash; Good to see larger involvement in Android open source.
  * **<a target="_blank" href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/04/iphone-4-antennagate-settlement-checks-arriving-in-the-mail/">iPhone 4 &#8220;antennagate&#8221; settlement checks arriving in the mail</a>** &mdash; Funny, I tried to get a bumper, and it never really worked out. Not that I&#8217;ve had huge problems, though.
  * **<a target="_blank" href="http://lifehacker.com/bittorrent-sync-keeps-your-files-in-sync-skips-the-ins-478810621">BitTorrent Sync Keeps Your Files In Sync, Skips the Insecure Cloud</a>** &mdash; Really interesting idea; could be great for personal music libraries, etc. Not sure how it would work on tablets and phones, though.
  * **<a target="_blank" href="http://lifehacker.com/how-an-energy-audit-saved-my-family-2-400-a-year-477840207">How an Energy Audit Saved My Family $2,400 a Year</a>** &mdash; A coworker had a similar experience once. Heating oil is something to watch out for. Stories like this make me nervous when considering housing options.
  * **<a target="_blank" href="http://tinyapps.org/blog/nix/201304230700_tiny_database.html">KISSDB: Tiny database</a>** &mdash; Very short code, seems like it could be useful. I&#8217;d love to see example uses.
  * **<a target="_blank" href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/04/monty-changes-roles-goes-big-with-mariadb-and-gains-wikipedia-as-a-user/">Monty changes roles, goes big with MariaDB--and gains Wikipedia as a user</a>** &mdash; Oracle&#8217;s role in MySQL (and OpenOffice) make many people wary; good to see this fork gain momentum.
  * **<a target="_blank" href="http://lifehacker.com/can-i-get-drm-free-movies-and-tv-shows-without-pirating-477555875">Can I Get DRM-Free Movies and TV Shows Without Pirating?</a>** &mdash; Pretty much sums up the state of things. I&#8217;m still unhappy about a TV season I bought in iTunes; I&#8217;m avoiding purchase of digital video unless they&#8217;re free from DRM, and you should consider doing the same. Rental is an okay option (e.g. Netflix, etc), but doesn&#8217;t seem like the end of the conversation.
  * **<a target="_blank" href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/04/chicken-meets-egg-with-facebook-chrome-webp-support/">Chicken meets egg with Facebook, Chrome WebP support</a>** &mdash; I&#8217;m really hoping WebP and WebM can catch on. It seems very reliant on finding a good scheme of browsers declaring what formats they understand, and a good option for users.
  * **<a target="_blank" href="http://lifehacker.com/why-the-gap-is-the-personal-finance-number-that-matte-476815605">Why "The Gap" Is the Personal Finance Number That Matters the Most</a>** &mdash; I read a treatment of this a few years ago, and it&#8217;s still something I keep in mind today.
  * **<a target="_blank" href="http://imgur.com/gallery/WYEht">Genius ideas -- Imgur</a>** &mdash; Reminded me of [last week&#8217;s MacGyver tricks](http://www.benjaminoakes.com/2013/04/22/weekly-roundup-2/).
  * **<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lee.org/blog/2013/04/05/comment-stuffing/">Lee.org -- [Feedly] Comment Stuffing by Sockpuppets</a>** &mdash; Makes me unsure of Feedly, and happy that I&#8217;m using [Tiny Tiny RSS](http://tt-rss.org/redmine/projects/tt-rss/wiki).
  * **<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi8adI4e2Lk">LeVar Burton on Why &#8216;Reading Rainbow&#8217; Was Cancelled (Media Beat 2 of 3) -- YouTube</a>** &mdash; I already knew that [No Child Left Behind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_child_left_behind) was bad, but I didn&#8217;t know it&#8217;s what killed Reading Rainbow. Interesting discussion, although I don&#8217;t think an iPad app is going to reach the kids who need it. Good for teachers (and teachers-to-be) to watch. :)
