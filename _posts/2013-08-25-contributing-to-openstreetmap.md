I think [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) is a pretty cool idea. It&#8217;s basically &#8220;the map version of Wikipedia&#8221;. If you don&#8217;t like the official interface, there are alternatives, such as [MapQuest Open](http://open.mapquest.com/).

Although I&#8217;ve used it off and on for over a year, I just made my first edits today, including [adding covered bicycle parking to downtown Iowa City](http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/changeset/17507415). It&#8217;s surprisingly easy to do.
