I&#8217;ve had the great pleasure of working with some other local Ruby developers to reignite [NewHaven.rb](http://www.twitter.com/newhavenrb) over the last few weeks. Our second official event is a &#8220;Ruby, White, and Blue Hackfest&#8221; tomorrow, July 1st. It&#8217;s going to run from 6-9 pm at Blue State (the [Wall St location](http://www.bluestatecoffee.com/stores/bsc-newhaven-wallst.php)). Everyone is welcome -- don&#8217;t worry about skill level! You bring a laptop, we bring the community.

Right now, the plan is to get together and work on [a few projects](http://github.com/newhavenrb) that group members are interested in, including our upcoming [website](http://github.com/newhavenrb/NHV-Ruby-site). I&#8217;d also like to talk about what we should do for our next event. 

If you&#8217;re planning on coming, please [RSVP](http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dGlQQld3V3FWc3dsaWQzdXVvX01BZmc6MQ).
