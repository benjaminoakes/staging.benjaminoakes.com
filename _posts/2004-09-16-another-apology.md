I&#8217;m no longer allowed to have a life; school has taken it over completely. In just a few hours, I have to play for Jazz Band then I&#8217;ll probably be up past midnight trying to get my homework done.

Yeah, and I&#8217;m here blogging. It&#8217;s not something I do enough of, in the first place.

Interestingly, I found an [article](http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2003/07/10/nadd.html) about me. OK, not me specifically, but pretty darn close. If anybody knows me, they&#8217;ll look at that and say &#8220;That&#8217;s Ben!&#8221; People do that sort of thing to things in movies, etc. because of things I habitually do; this is no exception.

Read it. There&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;re affected as well. Too bad it&#8217;s not a real syndrome (the day the word &#8220;nerd&#8221; is part of a real disease is a sad day). I had read something about [Asperger&#8217;s disorder](http://www.aspergers.com/) and thought that it was like me. I don&#8217;t think that there&#8217;s a name for what&#8217;s wrong with me though.  :P

In any case, time to get back to homework.
