[Apple Is Rejecting Some Apps From The App Store For Declaring Pebble Watch Support &#8211; Things Don&#8217;t Look Good For Android Wear On iOS](http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/04/23/apple-is-rejecting-some-apps-from-the-app-store-for-declaring-pebble-watch-support-things-dont-look-good-for-android-wear-on-ios/).

> Remember that report that claimed Google was preparing to make the Android Wear platform compatible with iOS? Yeah, that might not go down as smoothly as you had hoped. There&#8217;s still no official word on Wear for iOS, but the latest news out of the Apple camp has disturbing implications. According to one developer over on the official Pebble Watch forum, Apple is rejecting apps from its App Store simply for mentioning Pebble wearable support. 

Yikes. That&#8217;s a scary precedent and very clearly anticompetitive.
