[Neither Microsoft, Nokia, nor anyone else should fork Android. It’s unforkable. - Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/02/neither-microsoft-nokia-nor-anyone-else-should-fork-android-its-unforkable/).

An interesting take on Google&#8217;s Android strategy. In summary, Android is Open Source, but Google is really pushing that apps depending on proprietary Google Mobile Services (GMS). This explains why some apps aren&#8217;t in the Amazon Appstore. I&#8217;d be interested in how Cyanogen Mod is solving the GMS problem.

At any rate, the only service that is really discussed is in-app purchases... I&#8217;ve never made an in-app purchase, so that wouldn&#8217;t be a deal breaker for me (although I have purchased apps before). I could see how that would be a big blow to [the current mobile gaming industry](http://www.benjaminoakes.com/2014/02/09/how-in-app-purchases-have-destroyed-the-industry/ "How In-app Purchases Have Destroyed The Industry"). I would imagine Google&#8217;s mapping service is another... but it&#8217;s hard to say what other GMS services I would really care about.
