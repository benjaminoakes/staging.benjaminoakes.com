The PalmOne [Treo 650](http://www.palmone.com/us/products/smartphones/treo650/) was just [formally announced](http://www.treocentral.com/content/Stories/472-1.htm). I&#8217;ve been using my (don&#8217;t laugh) [Zire 31](http://www.palmone.com/us/products/handhelds/zire31/) more than I ever thought I would, considering what I paid for it. Being my first foray into the handheld world, I thought it was enough to not break the bank, plus if I were to lose it, not hard to replace. Now I don&#8217;t know what I would do without it. Of course, the screen makes me wish I would have gone for the [Tungsten E](http://www.palmone.com/us/products/handhelds/tungsten-e/).

My uncle had bought me a [TracFone](http://www.tracfone.com/home_page.jsp?b=n&flash=YES&p=W), which I was always scared to use, fearing running out of minutes. Since I&#8217;m going of to [college](http://www.uiowa.edu/) just next year, a cell phone might just become more useful. At nearly $600 the Treo 650 had better be the best thing I will ever own; judging from the [media&#8217;s](http://blog.treonauts.com/) [response](http://www.palminfocenter.com/view_story.asp?ID=7237), it might just be. However, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll wait for my Zire to die. By then, I hope, there would be a drop in price.

On that note, I went searching for a Palm OS magazine today, but all I could find were general mobile computer ones. It would do, I suppose, but if half (or more) of the magazine is about Pocket PC, it&#8217;s not really worth the money. Anyone know of one?
