> [WebAssembly](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design), “wasm” for short, `.wasm` filename suffix, a new binary syntax for low-level safe code, initially co-expressive with asm.js, but in the long run able to diverge from JS’s semantics, in order to best serve as common object-level format for multiple source-level programming languages.

I have high hopes for this.
