I&#8217;ve seen a lot written about reasons why your organization should keep a monolithic repository instead of a collection of many smaller repositories, especially for internal code (non-OSS). I&#8217;ve had similar experiences to what is described in these posts.

And before you think &#8220;we&#8217;re getting too big for that,&#8221; keep in mind that these recommendations are coming out of big players like Facebook and Google.
