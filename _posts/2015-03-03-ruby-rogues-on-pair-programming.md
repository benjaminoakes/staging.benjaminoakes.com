[026 RR Pair Programming -- Ruby Rogues -- DevChat.tv](http://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/029-pair-programming).

I&#8217;ve looked this up too many times in conversations with coworkers, so I&#8217;m bookmarking it with this post.

These are their bullet points for the podcast:

>   * Driver/Navigator vs Driver/Driver
>   * One person writes a test, the other makes it pass (Ping-pong pairing)
>   * It can be more productive
>   * Code review
>   * Shortens code review cycle
>   * Higher engagement
>   * Raises the quality floor
>   * Pairing effectiveness
>   * Less likely to rabbit hole
>   * We learn from each other
>   * Better code quality
>   * Transmitting information
>   * Lowers your bus number
>   * Territoriality and knowledge silos
>   * Learning new things from people who know how to do them better
>   * Challenging peoples&#8217; assumptions
>   * Ability to roll new teams in
>   * Pass on programming practices and culture
>   * Lower defect rates
>   * Fewer failed launches
>   * Maintainability is higher
>   * To get started: 
>       * Have a neutral setting for pairing. Location. Software. etc.
>       * Use a text editor you&#8217;re both comfortable with.
>       * Use driver/navigator.
>       * Communicate well.
>   * Keep your partner apprised of where you&#8217;re going
>   * Pair programming is a learned skill
>   * You have to get your ego in check
>   * Reduce barriers to collaboration
