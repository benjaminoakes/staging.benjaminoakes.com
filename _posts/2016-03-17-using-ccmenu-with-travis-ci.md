> CCMenu is a little tool for the OS X status bar to keep track of your repositoriesâ€™ latest build status from the convenience of your Mac.
> 
> CCTray is the equivalent tool for your Windows environment, BuildNotify for Linux systems. The general instructions apply to all of them.
> 
> They were originally built for use with CruiseControl, but they work just as well with Travis CI, and you can use either to poll your Travis CI repositories and have their status show in the menu bar or tray.
