I recently set up automated watering in our backyard. The gutters on our garage fill a rain barrel that has a timer attached to a soaker hose that runs through the garden. This is especially nice solution because (1) there&#8217;s no running water on that side of the house, (2) the rain water is free, (3) I can spend gardening time on other tasks, and (4) the chipmunks that used to love to hide in that downspout have to find another home now. It&#8217;s not fertilizing like in this article, but it wouldn&#8217;t be hard to add if we wanted to.

If there&#8217;s any interest, I might make a video of this. Please let me know in the comments.
