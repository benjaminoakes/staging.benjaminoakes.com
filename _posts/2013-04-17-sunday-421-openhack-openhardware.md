Just a friendly reminder that it&#8217;s almost the 3rd Sunday of the month, so we&#8217;ll be getting together for [OpenHack](http://openhack.github.io/iowa_city/) over at [Busy Coworking](http://busycoworking.com/).

The event is open to the public. [RSVP on Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Iowa-Open-Source-Hardware-meetup/events/114703992/).
