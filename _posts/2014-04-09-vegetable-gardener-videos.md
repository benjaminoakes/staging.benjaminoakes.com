[Video: Planting Out -- Vegetable Gardener Videos](http://www.vegetablegardener.com/item/6454/video-planting-out).

I&#8217;m getting ready to move some plants I started inside out to our yard, so this video was helpful. They have a lot of good information in their video series. Here&#8217;s a quick list:

  * Selecting a Site
  * Testing Your Soil
  * Removing Sod and Vegetation
  * Building Raised Beds
  * Starting Seeds Indoors
  * Direct Sowing Vegetable Seeds

Also, it looks like they&#8217;re somewhere in southern Connecticut, which was a funny coincidence, since I used to live there.
