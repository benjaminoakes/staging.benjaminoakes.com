[Back on Linux â€” dywypi.org](http://dywypi.org/2012/02/back-on-linux.html).

This is pretty much exactly how I feel about switching from OSX back to Linux. My guess is that a lot of developers have similar sentiments. In fact, I overbought RAM (8GB) because I was so used to running out on OSX. Although it&#8217;s hardly perfect, I&#8217;m pretty happy with Ubuntu on a day-to-day basis.

>     About a month ago I moved to Stockholm, Sweden and started working at <a href="http://spotify.com">Spotify</a>. A month before starting I was asked about my preferred setup for working. Having used OS X for year as the primary operating system at work the choice was clear, I wanted to go back to Linux, in this case to Debian to be exact.

>     There&#8217;s one thing that really stands out of Apple&#8217;s laptops, the build quality. The aluminium unibody is manufactured with precision, there&#8217;s no air intakes in the bottom of the machine (this is really useful if you use a laptop in your lap) and the peripherals, like the touchpad, are top quality. I really miss those and keep on wondering why there&#8217;s no PC manufacturers that would have the same overall quality of the hardware.

Feature that I probably miss the most was the somewhat smart handling of external displays, along with the brilliant multitouch gestures of the touchpad.

>     However, the operating system was in no way par with the hardware. Biggest grief was the memory usage. Judging from the interwebs, the most developers purchased 8 gigabytes of memory on their machines to start with. I had four. For web development, Python programming and such four is more than plenty. Except if you&#8217;re running OS X, apparently.

>     OS X has a feature called <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1342">inactive memory</a>. This is memory that was recently used by an app you closed and can be quickly made to active memory if you resume to use that app. A nice concept, that fails miserably. OS X&#8217;s documentation says, that this memory <em>may</em> be freed at any moment. However in practice, it just keeps on<br /> accumulating until you run out of free memory. In this case a sane option for the OS would be freeing the inactive memory. Instead the OS X decides to <em>swap the inactive memory on the disk</em>. So when running out of free memory and having a 1,5 gigabytes of inactive memory left, your OS starts paging the <em>unused</em> inactive memory to disk instead of freeing it for applications to use. Not only this causes your computer to slow down, it also is counter-intuitive in the terms of the original idea of inactive memory: when it&#8217;s on disk, it definitely is not made<br /> active quickly.

>     I managed to find out that this memory can be freed with combination of XCode&#8217;s <code>purge</code>-command and repairing <em>disk</em> permissions. First usually freed around 200MB of memory while latter freed almost every bit of inactive memory. Eventually this became a daily routine. When arriving to work the first thing was to hit repair disk permissions button and do something else than actually use the computer for the next five to ten minutes. Sigh.

>     There are at least four different ways of installing software on OS X. Download a DMG image, drag the icon from there to Applications folder, run an installer, install stuff from Mac App Store or compile it yourself. There seems to be no standard way how to do this properly. Of course, being a software dev, I ended up using the last alternative a lot.

>     When you have pretty much unified hardware (32/64-bit Intel) with pretty limited number of operating system versions, one could think that distributing binaries would be the way to go. Apparently it is not. Using homebrew is like using Gentoo, except that it&#8217;s even more<br /> screwed up. There&#8217;s no central repository for sources, it tries to download everything from the projects sites using different methods. After that, it compiles <em>everything</em>. Want to install library X? Please wait, compiling and downloading tons of crap from the interwebs, might take tens of minutes of wall time.

>     I&#8217;m a long time <a href="http://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> user, but this time I decided to go with <a href="http://debian.org">Debian</a>. Why? Mostly because our servers are Debian and because latest updates of Ubuntu have mostly focused on breaking the desktop environment. With Debian Squeeze I get the old and reliable Gnome 2.30 with the ability of pinning newer packages from either backports or from testing and unstable distributions.

>     Most notably I get the ultimate software installation tool, <code>apt-get</code>. A tool that installs <em>binary</em> packages with their dependencies. A tool, that&#8217;s universally supported by Google et al., so I don&#8217;t even have any problems installing newest Chrome, for example.

>     Sure. Even though Linux in modern times mostly works out of the box, there&#8217;s still slight issues with external displays, for example I can&#8217;t set the 30&#8243; Dell monitor at work to be the only display without doing some <code>xrand</code> magic. I guess that&#8217;s really the only thing I&#8217;m missing from OS X, a sane and automatic way of handling external displays. I also miss the Macbook&#8217;s superior touchpad, the joystick of Lenovo is nothing in comparison.
