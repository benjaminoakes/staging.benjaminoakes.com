[Tim Cook: &#8220;I&#8217;m Proud to be Gay&#8221; -- Businessweek](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-30/tim-cook-im-proud-to-be-gay).

Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple.  From his article:

> For years, I’ve been open with many people about my sexual orientation. Plenty of colleagues at Apple know I’m gay, and it doesn’t seem to make a difference in the way they treat me. [...] While I have never denied my sexuality, I haven’t publicly acknowledged it either, until now.
> 
> [...]
> 
> I don’t consider myself an activist, but I realize how much I’ve benefited from the sacrifice of others. So if hearing that the CEO of Apple is gay can help someone struggling to come to terms with who he or she is, or bring comfort to anyone who feels alone, or inspire people to insist on their equality, then it’s worth the trade-off with my own privacy.

It&#8217;s great to have a well written piece from a well-known executive (and role model).  That&#8217;s a pretty brave thing to do, especially when you consider he&#8217;s the only openly-gay CEO of a Fortune 500 company.  The only unfortunate thing is that he almost seems to think his work is done... I have a feeling this isn&#8217;t the last time he speaks about this topic.
